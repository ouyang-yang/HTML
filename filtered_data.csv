About Bad Boy Entertainment:

In 1993, Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, also known as Diddy, launched Bad Boy Records. Nobody could have
imagined the impact the label would have on pop culture. As a subsidiary of the larger Bad Boy
Entertainment, the label became best known for its signature sound of streetwise hip-hop soul and the
ghetto fabulousness that radiated like precious jewels from its very name. Bad Boy was designed for
those who aspired higher, but also wanted to party until the break of dawn. Puffy had seen life from
both sides of the class divide and, with his groove-heavy music, worked hard to merge the two. There is
no better visual embodiment of this merger than the groundbreaking videos that were in heavy rotation
on BET and MTV and now on YouTube.

The Bad Boy Entertainment channel is the official YouTube home of iconic music videos from Puff
Daddy, Craig Mack, Faith Evans, 112, Total, Mase, Yung Joc, Cassie, Danity Kane, and the rest of the Bad
Boy Family, and your destination for some of the biggest 90s and 00s hip-hop hits of all time like Craig
Mack’s “Flava In Your Ear (Remix)”, the Notorious B.I.G. tribute “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy feat.
Faith Evans and 112, and Cassie – “Me & U”.

Lyrics: 
This is what a woman wants
Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date that's fine
But he better be on time

Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day
And if I change my mind
A million times
I want to hear him say
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah, I like it that way
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fire breathin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Well any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He better say, mm, I like it like that, yeah
And if I change my mind
A million times
I want to hear him say
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah I like it that way
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows, how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fire breathin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ

CHORUS 1:
What a beautiful Name it is
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a beautiful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

VERSE 2:
You didn’t want heaven without us
So Jesus You brought heaven down
My sin was great Your love was greater
What could separate us now

CHORUS 2:
What a wonderful Name it is
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a wonderful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

The Name of Jesus

BRIDGE:
Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silence the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever God You reign
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names

What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful Name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

Letra  🎵

Ya casi es primavera
Hay flores en el jardín
Del frío ya nada queda 
Y no más que no vuelves aquí

Ya casi se acaba marzo
Y empiezo a sentir que es abril
El día de mi cumpleaños
De regalo quisiera pedir

Por favor, que su amor
Regresara aunque sea solo un ratito
De los dos, solo yo
Se quedó aquí más muerto que vivo
Que al dolor he aprendido a llamarlo amigo
Porque no creo que ella vuelva conmigo

Por favor, que su amor
Regresara aunque sea un ratito
De los dos, solo yo
Se quedó aquí más muerto que vivo
Que al dolor he aprendido a llamarlo amigo
Porque no creo que ella vuelva conmigo

Por favor, que su amor
Regresara aunque sea un ratito
De los dos, solo yo
Se quedó aquí más muerto que vivo

Y al dolor he aprendido a llamarlo amigo
Porque no creo que ella vuelva conmigo
No creo que ella vuelva conmigo

Synopsis:
Choices... to choose between right or wrong is simple, but what defines one's life is the decision between the greater of two goods or the lesser of two evils. This is the advice that Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol) receives from her father just as she is about to venture out into the world of her own for the very first time. Little does she know that these very words will shape her life.

Zooni, a blind Kashmiri girl, meets Rehan Qadri (Aamir Khan), a local Delhi tour guide and an incorrigible flirt. Her friends warn her against this good-for-nothing roadside Romeo, but she chooses to ignore them. It is now her time to discover life and love. Is this really the right choice?

Rehan is fascinated by Zooni and wants her to see life as it should be seen, in its many colours. He promises her that the time spent with him will be the most precious in all her life. Zooni sees Delhi, life and love like she never has before, because of Rehan.

What Zooni doesn't know is that Rehan has another side of his life that he has kept from her - something that can not only change her life, but can also destroy it.

Song Lyrics:

Suno Na Kahe Kya 
Suno Na
Dil Mera Suno Na
Suno Zara
Teri Bahon Mein
Mujhe Rehna Hai Raat Bhar
Teri Bahon Mein
Hogi Subah

Be Intehaan Be Intehaan
Be Intehaan
Yun Pyaar Kar
Be Intehaan
Koi Kasar Na Rahe
Meri Khabar Na Rahe
Choole Mujhe Iss Kadar
Be Intehaan

Jab Saanson Mein Teri
Saasein Ghuli Toh
Phir Sulaghne Lagey
Ehsaas Mere Mujhse
Kehne Lagey

Haan Bahon Mein Teri
Aake Jahan Do
Yoon Simatne Lagey
Sailaab Jaise
Koi Behne Lagey
Khoya Hoon Main
Aagosh Mein
Tu Bhi Kahan
Ab Hosh Mein
Makhmali Raat Ki
Ho Naa Subah

Be Intehaan Be Intehaan
Yun Pyaar Kar
Be Intehaan
Koi Kasar Na Rahe
Meri Khabar Na Rahe
Choole Mujhe Iss Kadar
Be Intehaan

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Yeah
The world is my expense
The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire
So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed
Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 2]
The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, hey
Sleep now in the fire

[Verse 3]
For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that makes you ill

[Pre-Chorus]
The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist, the fields' overseer
The agents of orange, the priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire
Yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire

Lyrics:
Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are going to be friends
I can tell that we are going to be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns, and books, and show and tell
Playtime, we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
 
And we don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream, while I’m in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends

Lyrics:
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
 
And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""
 
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
 
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""
 
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
 
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""",Seven Nation Army (The Glitch Mob Remix) (Official Video),TheWhiteStripesVEVO,,Mitski

Lyrics:
If you think that a kiss is all in the lips
C'mon, you got it all wrong, man
And if you think that our dance was all in the hips
Oh well, then do the twist
If you think holding hands is all in the fingers
Grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and
Make sure to never do it with the singer
Cause he'll tell everyone in the world
What he was thinking about the girl
Yeah, what he's thinking about the girl, oh

A lot of people get confused and they bruise
Real easy when it comes to love
They start putting on their shoes and walking out
And singing ""boy, I think I had enough""
Just because she makes a big rumpus
She don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boy
Take a tip and do yourself a little service
Take a mountain turn it into a mole
Just by playing a different role
Yeah, by playing a different role, oh

The boat, yeah, you know she's rockin' it
And the truth well ya know there's no stoppin' it
The boat, yeah, you know she's still rockin' it
The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it
 
So what, somebody left you in a rut
And wants to be the one who's in control
But the feeling that you're under can really make you wonder
How the hell she can be so cold
So now you're mad, denying the truth
And it's hidden in the wisdom in the back of your tooth
Ya need ta spit it out, in a telephone booth
While ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'em
Where do you think she goes
Oh yeah, where d'ya suppose she goes, oh

The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it
And the boat well yeah know she's still rockin' it
The boat well you know she's still rockin' it
And the truth, yeah you know there's no stoppin' it

You recognize the effect and the wreck
That it’s causin' when she rocks the boat
But it’s the clause hidden in the Cardinal Laws
'bout the proper place to hang her coat
So to you, the truth is still hidden
And the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but
You should know that the doctors weren't kiddin?
She's been singing it all along
But you were hearin' a different song
Yeah you were hearin' a different song
But you were hearin' a different song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hey, little apple blossom
What seems to be the problem?
All the ones you tell your troubles to
They don't really care for you
Come and tell me what you're thinking
'Cause just when the boat is sinking
A little light is blinking
And I will come and rescue you
 
[Chorus]
Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to
 
[Verse 2]
Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort 'em out for you
 
[Chorus]
Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to
 
[Verse 3]
Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out for you
 
[Outro]
I'll fall in love with you
I think I'll marry you",The White Stripes - Apple Blossom (Official Music Video),TheWhiteStripesVEVO,Yeti Beats,Swedish House Mafia

Summary: 
After years of life on the road and with their role models, the Allman Brothers Band, struggling to survive the deaths of two of its most distinctively talented members, today Lynyrd Skynyrd has become the quintessential Southern Rock band. Under the leadership of frontman and primary songwriter Ronnie Van Zant, the group's melodic lyric driven ballads and power driven hard rockers would catapult the group into one of the most popular touring bands in the world. The group's distinctive guitar attack, combined with an overtly defiant and rebellious attitude, gave them a cultural identity that would help make songs like ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""Free Bird"" into anthems of American rock music and staples of FM radio right up to the present day.

Headlining a bill that also featured the Outlaws, this Winterland recording captures Lynyrd Skynyrd following the release of their fourth album, Gimme Back My Bullets. This was during a transitional phase for the band, following the departure of guitarist Ed King, but prior to his replacement, Steve Gaines, coming on board. The band was carrying on as a six-piece unit, augmented by the Honkettes on backing vocals.  

This is an interesting time to hear the band live, as their trademark three-guitar attack was reduced by one guitar, leaving more room for keyboardist Billy Powell. On the ballads, like ""Tuesdays Gone"" and the pre-jam verses of ""Freebird,"" Powell displays great creativity and expands the keyboard's role in these songs.

Otherwise, the band rocks as hard as ever, with a good selection of their most popular songs, sampling a bit from all four of their studio albums. The group's defiant Southern swagger, combined with an infectious guitar and piano driven groove, creates an irresistible combination that resonated far beyond the Southern states. Two of the standouts on this show are both well chosen covers, which the band redefines as their own; J.J. Cale's ""Call Me The Breeze"" and Jimmy Rogers' ""T For Texas."" Both of these are rearranged in classic Skynyrd style, with the latter closing the set and clearly displaying the root sound of the band at its best.  

The audience demands an encore and the band obliges with a monumental ""Free Bird."" It begins as a plaintive slow ballad, with Van Zant's distinctively sad vocals over the melodic keyboard playing of Powell and delicate slide guitar ornamentation from Rossington. However, it is the second section, which becomes an up-tempo guitar boogie, that really hits home. Here the guitarists cut loose to create one of the most distinctive solos of all time. Rossington and Collins turn this section into a soaring jam that also features impressive melodic bass playing from Wilkeson and furious keyboards from Powell. Following a brief reprise of the song, they turn on a dime back into the groove of the jam before bringing it to a climactic close. 

""Free Bird,"" more often than not, sarcastically, would become the most requested song of all time. For musicians, this inevitable request has become so tiresome, that the act of requesting it has become universally known as ""the mantra of the moron."" Still, this only goes to prove just how deeply this song has permeated American culture and is a testament to its enduring popularity, making it one of the true landmark rock songs of twentieth century music.",Lynyrd Skynyrd - Tuesday's Gone - 3/7/1976 - Winterland (Official),,Finneas O'Connell,

Lyrics
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day
and then you call me and it's not so bad
it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life 

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life",,DidoVEVO,Louis Bell,Flume

Lyrics:
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, ""Kill it before it grows""
He said, ""Kill it before it grows""
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I, so I had to shoot him down
I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Reflexes got the better of me
And what will be, will be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy

Lyrics:
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, 'n' how many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, 'n' how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind

Lyrics:
Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Ifin' you don't know by now
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do some how
When your rooster crows at the break a dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right
And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right
No it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear ya any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' wallkin' way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word, babe
So I just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

Lyrics:
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

Lyrics:
A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground
I don't know who he is but I think that you do
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?

Something in my heart and in your eye
Tells me he's not someone just passing by
And when you cleared your throat
Was that your cue?
Dad-gum-it!
Who is he, and what is he to you?

When I add the sum of you and me
I get confused and keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man but not enough for two
Dad-gum-it! Who is he, and what is he to you?

You tell me men don’t have much intuition
Is that what you really think or are you wishin’?
Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new

The basic idea behind the video for ""Hunting High and Low"" is that love brings a man back in various forms to be near the woman he loves. Coldplay has been known to perform this song in concert, with a special nod to the band of their initial inspiration.

The a-ha channel is the official YouTube home of the Norwegian Pop trio a-ha, who achieved global stardom in 1985 when their debut single, “Take On Me” from the album ‘Hunting High And Low’ topped the charts in 36 different countries on its way to becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time, and the 5th most streamed song of the 20th century. a-ha struck chart gold again with “The Sun Always Shines On T.V.” and “Cry Wolf,” and recorded the theme to the 1987 James Bond film “The Living Daylights”. The a-ha YouTube channel is proud to host the music videos from these hits alongside live performance videos, lyric videos, and the solo work of band members Morten Harket (lead vocals), Paul Waaktaar-Savoy (Guitar), and Magne Furuholmen (Keyboards).",a-ha - Hunting High and Low (Official Video),a-ha,,Arcade Fire

Lyrics

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
Ha ah ah ah ah ah
And if only you could see into me

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

When you're on the outside baby and you can`t get in
I will show you you're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone and you can't get back again
I will find you darling and I will bring you home

And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time
You'll be fine

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
Ha ah ah ah ah ah
And if only you could see into me

Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low
I'll be there
By your side baby

Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh when you're low
I'll be there
By your side baby

Lyrics:
VERSE
I’ve been to hell and back 
So often I forgot how it hurt
For all the hate I got 
I hate that I Believed every word
But only you could see
All that I couldn’t see 
I’ve been to hell and back
But now I’m done with that 

PRE
I’m slipping into something new
Cause you gave me a Brand new truth
Yeah you got me and I got you
And you should know

CHORUS
Wherever you go
You know I’ll follow you 
Wherever you go
I’ll ride and die with you 
Cuz I got 10 thousand reasons
To not let you go 
Wherever you go 
Wherever you go 

Aşkından ölsem yangına dönsem küle yok
Nere gitsem peşimde olan oldu yine bak
Kabahat sende değil
Sana kalbi verende
Aşkından ölsem yangına dönsem küle yok

Kal hep benimle
Nereye istersen giderim seninle müzik son ses
Nereye istersen gelirim seninle tamam son kez
İnan hiç farketmez
sen nasıl istersen
Nereye istersen gidelim seninle tamam son kez

Letra: 
Woah oh 
El negrito ojos claros
Llevo tiempo diciéndoselo, que algo mejor se merece
Perdiendo su tiempo sigue, sabiendo que no me pertenece

Y desde que la conocí se va con su amiga pa la disco
Pero cuando le sube la nota, siempre vuelve a mi 
Me dice vida mía yo se que tengo que dejar que tú hagas tus locuras

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Una locura, me encanta cuando lo hacemos en la Acura
Antes de llegar con la foto me tortura
Se vuelve loca si le aprieto la cintura
Ella es mi baby, se pasa to’a la noche apretaita conmigo 
Nadie sospecha porque ni por las redes la sigo
Solo somos amigos 
Como Piqué y Shakira 
Yo en mi cama la cuido, mi baby 
Se pasa to’a la noche apretaita conmigo 
Nadie sospecha porque ni por las redes la sigo
Solo somos amigos 
Como Piqué y Shakira 
Yo en mi cama la cuido, mi baby 

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Siempre que escucho una canción que me recuerda a ti
O una foto tuya atrevida que me llega a mi
Me activa el deseo, de ti me dan ganas
Y te llamo porque se que nunca hay trabas
Tú misma me dices que lo nuestro es eternity 
Porque ella es boyante no hace falta tu fatality 
En el 5 letras soy quien te penetra
Corleone cuando te lo hace high quality 
Te pones insanity porque soy tu debility
En privacidad lo que tenemos es un reality 
Hace con tu vida lo que quiera y yo lo permití
Pero tú me llama o yo te llamo y le caemos ahí 

Dime cual es el propósito que vea tus videos
Como esta el esposito me tienes bien loquito 
No entiendo cual es el problema, 
Si nos gustamos tanto cual es el dilema
Estoy tentado a tocarte, tentado a pecar
Por mi te secuestro y de aquí no te vas
Pero si vuelve a mi
Me dice vida mía yo se que tengo que dejar que tu hagas tus locuras  
Tentado a tocarte, tentado a pecar
Por mi te secuestro y de aquí no te vas
Pero si vuelve a mi
Me dice vida mía yo se que tengo que dejar que tu hagas tus locuras  

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Tú mi locura baby pasan las horas y más me pide más
No se cansa parece no tener final
Lo nuestro es una locura

Peão Apaixonado - Ao Vivo Em São Paulo / 2004
(Pinocchio)

Letra:
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora
Nada derruba um peão apaixonado
Que deixou em outro Estado
A mulher que mais adora
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora
Pula boi, pula cavalo
Pula cavalo e boi
Coração pula no peito
Lembrando o amor que se foi
Foi felicidade
Felicidade sim
Coração pula no peito
Saudade que não tem fim
Foi felicidade
Felicidade sim
Coração pula no peito
Saudade que não tem fim
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora
Nada derruba um peão apaixonado
Que deixou em outro Estado
A mulher que mais adora
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora
Nada derruba um peão apaixonado
Que deixou em outro Estado
A mulher que mais adora
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora
Pula boi, pula cavalo
Pula cavalo e boi
Coração pula no peito
Lembrando o amor que se foi
Foi felicidade
Felicidade sim
Coração pula no peito
Saudade que não tem fim
Foi felicidade
Felicidade sim
Coração pula no peito
Saudade que não tem fim
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora
Nada derruba um peão apaixonado
Que deixou em outro Estado
A mulher que mais adora
Eu vou com tudo
Hoje eu não fico de fora
Se a saudade apertar
Eu chego o reio e meto a espora

Lyrics

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
And thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know
I know and now

When all is done, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
Oh what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible (Impossible)
Impossible (Impossible)
(Impossible)

LYRICS
My Girlfriend's a dick magnet My Girlfriend's gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots, Tip the man he'll
Ring the bell, get her drunk she'll scream like hell.
Dirty girl, gettin' down, dance with guys from outta town.
Grab her ass, actin' tough. Mess with her, she'll fuck you up.
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned, but she's
Comin' back to my place tonight!

She likes to shake her ass she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend!

Red thong, Party's on, Love this song, sing along.
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home
No one really knows if she's drunk or is she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight. I say
No one really knows just how far she's gonna go,
But I'm gonna find out later tonight

Doesn't take her long to make things right.
But does it make her wrong to
Have the time of her life. the time of her life
My girlfriend's a dick magnet My girlfriend's gotta have it

She's a gold digger now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger.
Futures finished, there it went, savings gone,
The money spent

I look around and all I see is, no good, bad and ugly,
Man she's hot and fixed to be, the future
Ex-Miss Connolly!

She's a bad, bad girlfriend.
She's a bad, bad girlfriend.",Dooriyan - Dino James ft. Kaprila [Official Music Video],,Terrace Martin,

Lyrics:

Angel 
I’ve been afraid all of my life
Crippled with anxiety shame and doubt
And sometimes sometimes I’d like to shout
At the top of my lungs to just let it out
 
What has that fear ever done for me
But hold me back
O what has jealousy and hate ever done for you
But remind you of what you think you lack
 
So give me love and give me compassion
Self-forgiveness and give me some passion
I’ll love you even if you don’t love me
Oh oh
I’ll love you even if you can’t love me
 
All of this pain that I’ve kept concealed
Thought it didn’t speak it it couldn’t be real
But sometimes sometimes I feel I have to shout
At the top of my lungs to just let it out
 
What has that fear ever done for me oh
But hold me back
 
So give me love and give me compassion
Self-forgiveness and give me some passion
I’ll love you even if you don’t love me
Oh oh
I’ll love you even if you can’t love me
 
You’ve been staring at your mirror
Trying to make the picture clearer
But angel can’t you see who’s in front of you
 
So give me love and give me compassion
Self-forgiveness and give me some passion
I’ll love you even if you don’t love me
Oh oh
 
I’ll love you oh can’t you see you’re free
Oh angel can’t you see you’re free
Oh angel can’t you see you’re free

Blackmage and Buffet the sets everything else gna get a dagger up in your chest
Summoning baphomet I met him then I jump to my death

Pouya - swangin like an orangutan
blood stains gon hit the flo
I broke my nose and forgot my name
and who the fuck gon take me home ?
lost my phone in the pit
swang and a miss
kicked in the jaw for flaming a bitch
my eyes twitching from the blood drippin hunnid one thugs and they roll with me
got a midget mac in the Cadillac
with a thousand rounds that'll send you back to your grannies house with your paintes out got you lookin like a fuckin faggot now
you can't hang with me
stay low key that's my mystique
grew a tree and bought a hammock
just to hang my feet

Ghostemane - I thought I'd be dead by now

Comin up and never going back
Never going back to when nobody had my back
Still I won't crack a smile until the pain hits the brakes and just eases up off of me
Let me breathe
Let me breathe
Why can I not keep up with all of the
Self
deprecation
Brain fading
Leave me to die on the pavement

I never wanted this

I fucked that bitch
Till she bled on me
Under the trees at night
Dirt all on her hands and feet
Then left her red on read
Alone like she found me
I'm cursed to die alone I think I hear my daddy callin me

Lyrics:
Hello, nothing whats up

Big mouth ass n***as, shut the fuck up 


Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (shhhh) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin (don’t you say a thing) 

Imma put this pussy in his mouf (in his mouf) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 

(Verse 1) 
Why niggas always speakin on who I’m fuckin on 
He must’ve got excited when I FaceTimed with nothin on 
Them same lips that’s yappin be the same ones I nutted on 
Hunnid k (please) you know how much paper I be touching on 
That’s light 
Betta check my net worth 
Post a pic in his sweatshirt 
I bet it have my ex hurt 
That’s what I get for kissin on these frogs 
He got mad and told my business to the blogs 
Nigga pause 
I’m appalled 
Need to chill out 
Yeah I pulled up 
Then I bust then I peel out 
Said he was a boss but he Talkin like a groupie 
I knew he wasn’t ready for this pretty bitch coochie 

Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (shhhh) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin (don’t you say a thing) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf (in his mouf) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 

(Bridge) 
Don’t make me refund the dick 
Send his ass back cause he came to quick 
That shit wasn’t bussin 
I knew I shouldn’t have fucked him 
Something told me not to trust this nigga 
Now my business in the streets I should punch this nigga 
That shit wasn’t bussin 
I knew I should’ve fucked him 

(Verse2) 
But His vibe had me so moist 
Told him I wanna fuck him in his rolls Royce 
Sent over a car I had no choice 
Got to his estate and them gates opened up 
Licked around my waist and my legs opened up 
Can’t lie I was stuck For second 
He was givin me that pressure 
Like this nigga might be special 
He was doin all the extras 
I was lovin how he thuggin 
Yea he Pumpin and he pumpin 
Aww shit this nigga cumin 
Yikes 


CHORUS 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (shhhh) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin (don’t you say a thing) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf (in his mouf) 
Imma put this pussy in his mouf 
Don’t you tell nobody we fuckin (that’s right) 
Shut yo mouf nigga don’t say nothin

Lyrics
Shut up!

If you squeeze my lizard
I'll put my snake on you
I'm a romantic adventurer
And a reptile too

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death, killed by death
Killed by death, come on!
I'm a lone wolf ligger
But I ain't no pretty boy
I'm a backbone shiver
And I'm a bundle of joy

But it don't make no difference
'Cause I ain't gonna be, easy, easy
The only time I'm easy's when I'm
Killed by death, killed by death
Killed by death, come on!

Killed by death, Killed by death
Killed by death, come on!
Come on, I said you're killed by death
Come on!
Killed by

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Aah!

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by a bunch of death!

Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death
Shout out your mouth, shout out your mouth!

Come on!
Killed by death
Killed by death
Killed by death

I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead
I'm dead, I'm dead
Dead, dead, dead, killed by death

BANG!

I get up I get down
And I’m jumping around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I’m thinking it’s time to grow

So I got an apartment
Across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still I’m not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride
But I’m thinking it’s time to go
(Here we go)

So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang
Let’s go out with a bang

I’m way too young to lie here forever
I’m way too old to try so whatever
Come hang
Let’s go out with a bang

Feel like I’m gonna puke
Cause my taxes are due
Do my password begin with a one or a two?
Been a hell of a ride
But I’m thinking it’s time to grow
(Metronome)

Man I'm up to something
Oo-dee-la-dee-doe
Thank you all for coming
I hope you like the show
Cause it’s on a budget
So oo-dee-la-dee-doe
Yeah come on here we go
Yeah come on
(Here we go)

So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang
Let’s go out with a bang

I’m way too young to lie here forever
I’m way too old to try so whatever
Come hang
Let’s go out with a bang

Been a hell of a ride
But I’m thinking it’s time to go

So put your best face on everybody

[Lyrics]
Ooh, Ooh

I think you should know you saved my life

I don’t think you realize
What you’ve done for me 
Oh
I don’t think you realize 
What a little love could mean 

Oh you, you stay by my side 
And you, you kept on the lights
And you knew just what to say 
When I was fading 

Sometimes all that you need is
Someone who can believe in you 
More than you do 

I was lost until I saw your halo 
I was blind until I saw your light
I believe my friend 
We all have angels 
And you are mine 
I think you should know you saved my life 

Ooh, ooh 
I think you should know you saved my life

Ooh, ooh 
I think you should know you saved my life

I don’t think you realize
What your words can do 
Oh, the whole world was falling all around me 
But I held on 
To you 

Oh you, you stay by my side 
And you, you kept on the lights
And you knew just what to say 
When I was fading 

Sometimes all that you need is
Someone who can believe in you 
More than you do 

I was lost until I saw your halo 
I was blind until I saw your light
I believe my friend
We all have angels 
And you are mine 
I think you should know you saved my life 

Ooh, ooh 

I think you should know you saved my life
I was lost until I saw your halo 

Ooh, ooh

I was blind until I saw your light
I think you should know you saved my life
I believe my friend we all have angels 

Ooh, ooh

And you are mine 
(and you are mine)

LETRA

Justo cuando sale del hueco
en el que tu me dejaste con la luz pagada
Cuando había empezado algo nuevo
la pantalla me muestra tu maldita llamada
 
Me dices que me extrañas
Pero yo me se tus mañas
Me llamas cuando estas jodida
 
Tu vida es un enredo
Y yo no quiero ni puedo
Volver a ser tu salvavidas
 
Oye querida,
Estas perdida
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Oye querida,
Sigue tu vida
Que bastante me costó arreglar la mia
 
Yo se que te parece extraño
que tus ojos rojos ya no me hacen daño
Y mira, querida,
Las vueltas que nos da la vida
Y mira, querida,
Que ya no soy tu salvavidas
 
Me dices que recuerde lo bueno
Pero yo ya no puedo porque tu lo borraste
Esta flor se marchitó,
Este cuento se acabó,
Se te olvida que tu lo acabaste
Me dices que me extrañas
Pero ya me se tus mañas
Me llamas cuando estas jodida
Tu vida es un enredo
Y yo no quiero ni puedo
Volver a ser tu salvavidas
Oye querida,
Estas perdida
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Oye querida,
Sigue tu vida
Que bastante me costó arreglar la mia
Yo se que te parece extraño
que tus ojos rojos ya no me hacen daño
Y mira, querida,
Las vueltas que nos da la vida
Y mira, querida,
Que ya no soy tu salvavidas
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Tu sigue con tu vida y yo la mía
Me dices que me extrañas y ya me se tus mañas
Llamas cuando estas jodida
Tu vida es un enredo y yo no quiero ni puedo
Ser tu salvavidas
Oye querida,
Estas perdida
La ultima ya fue la despedida
Oye querida,
Sigue tu vida
Que bastante me costó arreglar la mia
Yo se que te parece extraño
que tus ojos rojos ya no me hacen daño
Y mira, querida,
Las vueltas que nos da la vida
Y mira, querida,
Que ya no soy tu salvavidas

► Testo

Il grigio delle strade e gli edifici ti resta addosso tipo abbronzatura
Ho vinto spesso con molti nemici, ho sempre perso con la mia natura
Ma poi ti sei insinuata, sinuosa
Con gli occhi verdi, pelle ocra e i tuoi capelli rosa
Quegli occhi cosi grandi, c’è spazio per entrambi, per la fragilità e per la ferocia
La mia Nefertiti, togliti i vestiti mama
Finché gridi so i tuoi giochi preferiti mama
Ami i rischi perché possono ferirti mama
Ho lati appuntiti mama
Come stalattiti mama

E la gente che ho attorno diceva
Chi si immerge in un sogno ci annega
Ciò che cerchi ti troverà

Crazy Love
Lei per me
Io per lei
Crazy Love
Ti direi, ti darei
Crazy Love
Dove sei, dove sei
Come una vertigine lontana mi chiama
Crazy Love
Sai che ne ho bisogno stasera
Crazy Love
Fumo mentre sopporto l’attesa
Dove sei, dove sei
Calamita e un po’ calamità

Siamo due gazzelle, siamo due levrieri
Sai tutti i miei trucchi, so i tuoi sortilegi
So che mi ameresti anche con zero money
Baciami respiro già i tuoi feromoni
Ti muovi felina, Selina, Nikita, sai come tenere alta la sfida
L’amore per me è fare una rapina e poi dividere la refurtiva
Siamo troppo explicit, svegliamo i vicini mama
Con quei tacchi e completini tu mi uccidi mama
Amo i rischi perché possono ferirmi mama
Hai lati appuntiti mama
Come stalattiti mama

E la gente che ho attorno diceva
Chi si immerge in un sogno ci annega
Ciò che cerchi ti troverà

Crazy Love
Lei per me
Io per lei
Crazy Love
Ti direi, ti darei
Crazy Love
Dove sei, dove sei
Come una vertigine lontana mi chiama
Crazy Love
Sai che ne ho bisogno stasera
Crazy Love
Brucio mentre sopporto l’attesa
Dove sei dove sei
Calamita e un po’ calamità",Usher - Love in This Club (Official Music Video) ft. Young Jeezy,Stones Throw,Mike Dean,The Chainsmokers

Taken from the album ‘Whenever You Need Somebody’ – deluxe 2CD and digital deluxe out 6th May 2022 Pre-order here – https://RickAstley.lnk.to/WYNS2022ID

“Never Gonna Give You Up” was a global smash on its release in July 1987, topping the charts in 25 countries including Rick’s native UK and the US Billboard Hot 100.  It also won the Brit Award for Best single in 1988. Stock Aitken and Waterman wrote and produced the track which was the lead-off single and lead track from Rick’s debut LP “Whenever You Need Somebody”.  The album was itself a UK number one and would go on to sell over 15 million copies worldwide.

The legendary video was directed by Simon West – who later went on to make Hollywood blockbusters such as Con Air, Lara Croft – Tomb Raider and The Expendables 2.  The video passed the 1bn YouTube views milestone on 28 July 2021.

Lyrics:
We’re no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of
You wouldn’t get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We’ve known each other for so long
Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it
Inside we both know what’s been going on
We know the game and we’re gonna play it

And if you ask me how I’m feeling
Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Lyrics

You give and give until it’s gone away 
Just tell yourself you’ve got another day 
You’ve lived that life you just don’t see it yet
I see how hard you’ve worked to be yourself 

If you believe that guy is Superman 
There selling tickets at the cinema 
Whatever gets you through the darkest night 
Just find the light out 
In the madness  
Hold tight 
 
Cos I’m a hard 
Man to lose 
But I figured it out 
Then made my way back
To a life 
I would choose 
We were lucky once 
I could be lucky again
 
Before the world it got so serious
Before the time it got away from us 
I’d meet you at the favourite subway stop
We’d grab some food then meet the lads for one 
 
If you believe that guy is Superman 
There selling tickets at the cinema 
Whatever gets you through the darkest night 
Just find the light out 
In the madness  
Hold tight 
  
Cos I’m a hard 
Man to lose 
But I figured it out 
Then made my way back
To a life 
I would choose 
We were lucky once 
Could be lucky again
 
I’m a hard 
Man to find 
But you figured it out
And I love you for that 
Look back
On a time 
I was lucky once 
I could be lucky again 

Cos I’m a hard 
Man to lose 
But I figured it out 
Then made my way back
To a life 
I would choose 
We were lucky once 
Could be lucky again
 
I’m a hard 
Man to find 
But you figured it out
And I love you for that 
Look back
On a time 
I was lucky once 
I could be lucky again

Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the booth into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, it's so comedic
At least I had it (Uh) instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
I know love is all I got
I just hope to God she got the taste
To put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

[Chorus]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Bridge]
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
Keep it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Going)
And now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3]
Ayo, there's poison in that gumbo
Emotion for Dumbo
Ask me where my luck go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesser talk, see the
Weatherman told me that it was raining
My stupid ass brought an umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and feel better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and illusion because I jet to conclusion
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood her fluent
She opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

[Outro]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus]
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I will never want to fall in love again
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh
But I don't ever want to fall in love again

[Bridge]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go

[Chorus]
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I will never want to fall in love again (Again)
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh
But I don't ever want to fall in love again

[Outro]
Again, again
Again, again

Official “Let Me Down” Lyrics: 

I leave your apartment at noon 
Wondering what the hell did I do
All these hoops that you put me thru 
I’m wasting my energy on you 

How high did you get me
Your side of the bedsheets always been empty
The way that you tempt me
I’m holding on

I’m sick of subwaying solo
Five hours fucked up in Soho
All my friends stayed uptown, stayed uptown 
I spend my paycheck to see ya 
Talk myself up in the mirror
So you could let me down, let me down 

No time for me on a weekday
You only hit me up when you’re out late
Yeah I wish I could hate you 
You could break my heart and I’d thank you babe 
And it’s always so painful 
You leave once you get what you came for 
Yeah I wish it was easy 
I know that you don’t really need me babe 

How high did you get me
Your side of the bedsheets always been empty
The way that you tempt me
I’m holding on

I’m sick of subwaying solo
Five hours fucked up in Soho
All my friends stayed uptown, stayed uptown 
I spend my paycheck to see ya 
Talk myself up in the mirror
So you could let me down, let me down 

Over and over again 
I get home 
Walk through the door 
And wonder what I did wrong 
Over and over my nights end up alone
You break my heart like it’s nothing

I’m sick of subwaying solo
Five hours fucked up in Soho
All my friends stayed uptown, stayed uptown 
I spend my paycheck to see ya 
Talk myself up in the mirror
So you could let me down, let me down

Iba by Zack Tabudlo ft. Moira Dela Torre

Lyrics:

1st verse
hindi ko ba nasabi sayo
mga kailangan kong itago
nung panahon na lagi kong nakikita
na iba ngiti mo
nahulog ka na ba sa iba
naghihintay na ba ko sa wala
wala naman palang tumatalab
sa ginawa ko para sating dalawa

alam ko na hindi na tayo
pero bat pinapamukha mo
di pa ba sapat lahat ng ginawa ko
may kulang ba sakin o sayo
may pakiramdam din naman ako
wag ka naman parang gago
ako pa lumalabas na masama
minahal naman kita ng buong buo

Chorus:
alam ko namang alam ko namang 
hindi ako ang hanap mo na ang hanap mo na
wag mo naman patagalin pa patagalin pa
kung wala namang nangyayari nangyayari na
nagmumukha nalang akong iba
sa dapat mundo nating dalawa
san na nga ba tayo pupunta
tinadhana naman pero naghahanap ka ng iba

ba ba ba ng iba (ng iba) 
ba ba ba ng iba (ng iba) 
ba ba ba ng iba (ng iba) 
ba di ko alam bat naghanap ng iba
ba ba ba ng iba 
ba ba ba ng iba (ng iba) 
bakit ba bakit ba naghanap pa ng iba

2nd verse
binalikan ko ang mga litrato
panahon na masaya pa tayo
hinahanap ko mga ngiti mo
(mukha namang totoo) 
pero bat bigla kang nag bago
nawala yung kinang sa mga mata mo
di naman siguro peke lahat ng ito
pero bakit ganito

nawawala na ata ko sa sarili
binigay ko ang lahat para sa pagibig
hindi ko na alam ang aking gagawin (gagawin) 
sinira mo na ko sa iba
ako na yung nagmumukhang masama
pero bat andito ako 
nagdurusa

2nd Chorus 
alam ko namang alam ko namang 
hindi ako ang hanap mo na ang hanap mo na
wag mo naman patagalin pa patagalin pa
kung wala namang nangyayari na nangyayari na
nagmumukha nalang akong iba
sa dapat mundo nating dalawa
san na nga ba tayo pupunta
tinadhana naman pero naghahanap ka ng iba

ba ba ba ng iba (ng iba) 
ba ba ba ng iba 
ba ba ba ng iba (ng iba) 
nagmumukha nalang iba
sa dapat mundo nating dalawa (sa dapat mundo nating dalawa) 
ano ba ang nangyari na (parang gago lang diba) 
tinadhana naman pero naghahanap ka ng iba)

This trio of songwriters, went on to have 3 number one records during the 1990's.

This video was filmed in Miami, Florida 1992 and directed by Andy Morahan. 

Lyric:

Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart - search your soul
And when you find me there you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Look into my heart - you will FIND
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am - take my life
I would give it ALL I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

There's no love - like your love
And no other - could give more love
There's nowhere - unless you're there
All the time - all the way

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you - Ya I'd die for you

Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

LYRICS: 
I threw my phone out of the window, I’m so over it
Weight on my shoulders, every day another storm to live
I’m standing at the ledge
My foot’s about to slide
What if it takes the fall for me to learn to fly
I try to run from what I’ve done
And it cost me everyone, all it left me was feeling numb

Sunrise stayed up ‘til the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I’m locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don’t pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain’t no saving

Dead man walking
A dead man walking

Russian roulette, I swear I don’t have many chances left
No I should change, but man I swear I’d rather dance with death
I’m just a desperate soul
Another broken human
I know some stars are falling
I know some stars are shooting
I get so high
I’m froze in time
Shattered pieces fell on the floor of a heart no longer pure

Sunrise stayed up ‘til the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I’m locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don’t pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain’t no saving

Dead man walking
A dead man walking

I threw my phone out of the window I’m so over it
Weight on my shoulders every day another storm to live

Sunrise stayed up ‘til the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I’m locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don’t pray too often
Knees down when the devil come calling
Ain’t no saving

Dead man walking
A dead man walking
Ain’t no saving
Dead man walking
A dead man walking

LYRICS:
We’ve been swinging and missin’
It ain’t broke yet
But damn it needs fixin’
Been awhile since your kiss felt like kissing
It’s just different
We’ve been talking bout forever
Since we’ve been together
Something bout a ring
Makes you think we’re better off with
All this
But we’re caught in

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place

For the record, shit
Throwing in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rolling down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
Between a rock and a hard place

We’ve been talking bout forever
Since we’ve been together
Something bout a ring
That makes you think we’re better off with
All this
But we’re caught in

Between a rock and a hard place
Tears rolling down your face
As I walked out the door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn I’m exhausted
What the hell’s this all for
Is this where it mends or it breaks
How much more of this can we take

Establishing himself as one of music’s most exciting new voices, Bailey Zimmerman strikes a sweet spot between timeless American country, rafter-rattling arena rock, and authentic storytelling. It’s why in just one year’s time, he’s already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80’s hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song “Never Comin’ Home” amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, “Fall In Love”, “Rock and A  Hard Place”, and “Where It Ends”. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.

LETRA:

Quien iba a pensar que con la misma lengua
Estaría tocando timbre en otra puerta
Quien iba a pensar que con mi billetera
Estaría comprando pan en otra tienda
No es tu asunto lo que yo haga por la calle
A ti te gusto mala

Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las cosas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las vainas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Mi mala

Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí

No me esperes que no sé si llego
Yo llego si me da la gana
Vos y yo dejamos claro el juego
Vos mi malo y yo tu mala

Hay unos días que ando loca por ti
Te veo y quiero todo lo que traes ahí
Y luego ya no quiero nada
Sí, yo soy así, así
Tú no lo puedes parar
Cada mañana quieres más y más
No me puedes evitar
Yo soy tu mala (su mala)

Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las cosas claras (ay ay ay ay ay ay)
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo (yeah)
Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las vainas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Mi mala

Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí (uoh)
Ahí, ahí, ahí (uoh)
Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí

Becky G
Si los celos y la rabia contaminan
Nos bañamos con jabón y se nos quita
No hay invento, ni secreto, ni mentira
Que los dos comemos de otra cucharita
Y luego por la mañana estamos como si nada
No es tu asunto lo que yo haga por la calle
A ti te gusto mala

Tú me dices que soy tu mala
Te quedas mirándome a solas y no me hablas
Porque te gusta que en la noche
Sea tu cuerpo quien me habla y quien me toque
Esto no es amor, ni entretenimiento
Es como una cosa que queda en el medio
Cuando quiero, quieres
Cuando quieras, quiero
Y si tú, y si tú

Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas
Dejemos las cosas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Si tú no me quieres
Si tú no me amas (no no no no)
Dejemos las vainas claras
Yo tampoco busco amor contigo, contigo
Mi mala

Sé que no eres sola
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí (te tengo aquí)
Y yo no soy solo
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti (en la palma de mi lengua)
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí (no, oh)
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Sé que no eres sola (sé que no eres solo)
Pa' mí, pa' mí, pa' mí
Y yo no soy solo (y yo no soy sola)
Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti
Pero nos tenemos
Ahí, ahí, ahí
Ahí, ahí, ahí (ahí)
Ahí, ahí, ahí (ahí)

Yo' Grace
No soy solo pa' ti mi amor
Pero a quién entiende' mami
Lali (cómeme la boca, mala, mala)
Mau y Ricky (cómeme la boca, mala, mala)
Con Karol G (cómeme la boca, mala, mala)
Karol G, Becky G, Leslie G, baby
Tú ere' mi mala
Ay, como me gusta mi mala
Cómeme la boca, mala, mala
Cómeme la boca, mala, mala

Lyrics: 

[Popcaan]
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me,
stay right next to me
[Toni-Ann]
You make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Feel it in my soul,
Leave me wanting more
Yea, you make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Don’t know where we’ll go,
Don’t know where we’ll go

[Popcaan x Toni-Ann]
Yea,
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me,
stay right next to me
But if you wanna go, I will go
if you wanna go, I will go
But if you wanna go, I will go
Just stay right next to me
[Popcaan]
We could go anywhere
Anywhere you choose
Take you on a cruise
Girl you are so beautiful
Love to see you smiling,
The love we have is never ending
Tell me how you feeling

[Toni-Ann]
You make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Feel it in my soul,
Leave me wanting more
Yea, you make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Don’t know where we’ll go,
Don’t know where we’ll go

[Popcaan x Toni-Ann]
Yea,
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me,
stay right next to me
But if you wanna go, I will go
if you wanna go, I will go
But if you wanna go, I will go
Just stay right next to me

[Toni-Ann Singh]
Ah, oh,
Met a few lifetimes ago
You were Anthony , I was Cleo
Made the world a place only we know
If it’s not love then tell me what’s this feeling you giving me
If it’s not love then I’m begging you baby to leave me
I shoulda never let it show
can see it in your eyes you know
Can see it in your eyes you know

[Toni-Ann]
You make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Feel it in my soul,
Leave me wanting more
Yea, you make me wanna run, run, run
Heartbeat racing like a drum, drum, drum
Don’t know where we’ll go,
Don’t know where we’ll go

[Popcaan x Toni-Ann]
Yea,
You don’t need to run away,
stay right next to me,
stay right next to me
But if you wanna go, I will go
if you wanna go, I will go
But if you wanna go, I will go
Just stay right next to me

RM explained on the Weverse live stream that his friends are always asking how he can forget things so easily all the time so he began to wonder why he is so forgetful, that’s how the song came to life, fitting his personality really well. But for me, this song goes perfectly when you're being comforted in nature as Kim Sawol says in the comment at the end of the video.

💜 This video is from a small yet intimate concert at Rolling Hall on December 5, 2022. RM returned to his roots, in the heart of Hongdae, where the rapper made a name for himself in the underground hip-hop scene when he was a teenager. It was his long-time dream to perform at Rolling Hall and 200 lucky fans were able to attend the concert. 

💜 If you like my videos please consider being a Patreon of mine 🙏 🙇‍♀️🙏 https://www.patreon.com/enjoybtsmore and if you already are one, thank you so much for your support, it means so much, more than you think it does! 🤗💜💜💜🤗

💜 Turn on CC if you want to read the subtitle, it's easy. Mouse over to the ‘CC’ button in your video manager and click on it. That turns on the CC or you can switch it off. The general ‘Options’ section allows you to increase the font size, change the font or color, and move the subtitle around to place it where you like.

💜 Please subscribe if you like English subtitles as an option to turn on while viewing BTS live performances and concert videos.

💜 My goal is to deliver English subtitles that are correctly translated, and easy to read and understand, whilst not being an element that disturbs or irritates you. 
But I cannot make the rappers rap slowly ;) 

💜 Regardless of the translation source for the subtitle, I also search for information about the meaning of the song and the lyrics. I fix errors, sync the subtitles to the video and replace words or sentences that need a better translation to make it easier to understand and/or follow the subtitles.

💜 I work on creating subtitles for BTS videos so that we can understand the songs better, as the lyrics are a big part of BTS music. I know a subtitle, as an option to turn on, will make people enjoy BTS more.

I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

Letras:

Ya te olvidé, vuelvo a ser libre otra vez, 
Vuelvo a volar hacia mi vida que está lejos 
Y prohibida para ti, 
Ya te olvidé, ya estás muy lejos de mí, 
Tú lo lograste con herirme, lastimarme 
Y convertirme en no sé qué. 

Me atrapaste, me tuviste entre tus manos 
Me enseñaste lo inhumano y lo infeliz que puedes ser 
Te fingiste exactamente enamorado 
Aunque nunca me has amado yo lo se 
Me dijiste que jamás podría olvidarte 
Que después iría a rogarte y a pedirte bésame 
Yo luche contra el amor que te tenía y se fue y ahora 
Ya te olvide.""",Cultura Profética - Un Deseo (Audio Oficial),11:11 Music Group,Terrace Martin,Alicia Keys

Lyrics:

[Intro]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Interlude]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 2]
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Bridge]
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Letra:

Hoy le ando echando chingazos 
Le andamos pegando duro para una vida mejor
Que me la paso pensando
Ando modo hacer dinero, no molesten por favor

Si por un lado les paso
Traigo activa la turbina, ya quedó atrás el motor
Si me ven que ando gastando
Una que otra camisita y una bolsa Louis Vuitton

Comenzamos desde abajo
Eliminé a la reversa y pa’ adelante como avión 
Si me ha costado trabajo
Pero jamás me le rajo porque esto es parte del show

Tranquilos en el relajo
Prefiero andar bien pendiente si surge una situación
Me lleva la que te trajo
Si no te pones avispa por eso soy como soy

Andamos bien, aunque les duela aquí andamos al 100
Los envidiosos no dan de comer y me la pelan lo que es

Puro campeón, los que traigo por un lado viejon
Poco a poquito formé este equipon y van pa’ arriba, si señor

Me han hecho malas caras 
Y luego me los topo para pedirme perdón

Les diera una patada
Pero una cachetada a guante blanco creo es mejor

Bastante gente rara
Que solo se me acercan para pedirme un favor
 
Dejo las cosas claras
Ayudo a los de siempre, no arrimo a cualquier cabron

Andamos bien, aunque les duela aquí andamos al 100
Los envidiosos no dan de comer y me la pelan lo que es

Puro campeón, los que traigo por un lado viejón
Poco a poquito formé este equipon y van pa’ arriba, si señor.

Lyrics:

Homegrown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

We're south of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea diving 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone

We got two in the front (hey)
Two in the back (hey)
Sailing along
And we don't look back (back, back)

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone (someone)
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like a someone, a someone, a someone, someone

Lyrics:
Let’s get it
Hop off a sixteen passenger
This a G5, no this not a challenger 
I keep some members with me and the freaks get coach seats
They some cannibals 
They like to get geeked, drink a whole bottle, wake up and repeat
She took a little shh mixed it with the chill out
Now she say she seeing 3D
I go in the jungle and I ain’t got a coat
I bet I come out with a mink
Do this shit for the fam, cuz this shit bigger than me
Color stones in my infinity link and in the factory masterpiece
I call him twin cuz that be my brother, we got the same Rollie he matching me
Nah for real 
 
Water on me like the sauna 
Some carets some pointers 
All these commas, I won’t fumble
Migo gunnas out the jungle 
Buy it all fuck a front up n
Can’t call me no fronter
Drop top feeling like stunner 
Can’t d play no runner we gone
Chrome heart wallet, smoke my pilot, take three vibes to the tropics
N* wasn’t shit, I was outside just servin narcotics
Claiming that stick, n made one wrong move just popped him 
Blame it on bro with the hoe flooded out in the hotel lobby 
 
Diamonds be dancing like Bobby
Don’t touch it, this glocky be cocky
Soon as G6 departed, we get it 
Bitches gone trend in the topics 
The way I pull up ima pop it and none of these n gone stop me
Put that shit on, get a cup for the drip 
I’m a mother fucking faucet
 
Keep stacking, your bank gone get bigger
Never will I throw some shade on no n* 
Lil n don’t play with these n* 
I see the big picture, we up on these n* 
The Huncho the one you gone call on these n*
I got your back you gone follow me n*
When I get up we gone ball on these n* 
Fucking shit up cause we beat out the system 
 
Water on me like the sauna 
Some carets some pointers 
All these commas, I won’t fumble
Migo gunnas out the jungle 
Buy it all fuck a front up n*
Can’t call me no fronter
Drop top feeling like stunner 
Can’t d play no runner we gone
Chrome heart wallet, smoke my pilot, take three vibes to the tropics
N* wasn’t shit, I was outside just servin narcotics
Claiming that stick, n* made one wrong move just popped him 
Blame it on bro with the hoe flooded out in the hotel lobby

LYRICS

Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart
You don't get burned
('Cause nothing gets through)
It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see...

Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love

Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect
And you, you can't live like this

Love ain't safe
You won't get hurt if you stay chaste
So you can wait
But I don't wanna waste my love",Pancho Barraza - Pero la Recuerdo (Cumbia Santa María) (Video Oficial),Macklemore,,Billie Eilish

Lyrics:
Baby ¿qué más?
Hace rato que no sé na’ de ti 
Taba con alguien pero ya estoy free 
Puesta pa’ revivir viejos tiempos
No salgo hace tiempo
Tú dime ¿dónde estás?
Que hace rato que no sé na’ de ti 
Taba con alguien pero ya estoy free 
Puesta pa’ revivir viejos tiempos no salgo hace tiempo

Papi nos perdemos 
Nos parqueamo’ y lo prendemos 
Pa’ la seca algo bebemo’
Y cuando nos emborrachemo’
Una de reggaeton ponemos 
Y nos vamo’  a donde nos podamos comer

¿Qué de malo puede pasar?
Que nos vaya mal
Toy afuera sal 
Tenemos cosas pendientes por repasar
Tú eres un pollito difícil de reemplazar

No sé si te convenza 
Nos damo’ un rocecito por Provenza 
Y si la cosa se pone tensa 
En mi cama es la recompensa 
O viceversa
¿Por qué lo piensas?
Pasamos por el barrio por hierba 
Ponlo hooka pa’ que se disuelva 
La química todavía se conserva 
Y yo te lo hago rico para que vuelva’ 

Aunque mañana me voy 
Aprovéchame que aquí estoy 
Puesta pa’ ti 
Por eso te escribí

Baby ¿qué más?
Hace rato que no sé na’ de ti
Taba con alguien pero ya estoy free
Puesta pa’ revivir viejos tiempos
No salgo hace tiempo
Tú dime ¿dónde estás?
Que hace rato que no sé na de ti
Taba con alguien pero ya estoy free 
Puesta pa’ revivir viejos tiempos no salgo hace tiempo

Julia Vitoria e Aline Barros apresentam ""Ele Vem"", single que tem a participação especial do coral One Service Project - que também esteve presente em ""Além do Rio Azul"". Este projeto de Julia busca resgatar algumas raízes da música cristã brasileira, por isso, a cantora incluiu um trecho de ""A Cidade Santa"", canção que esteve no primeiro LP de Aline Barros. 

Entre suas faixas mais conhecidas estão: ""De Dentro pra Fora"", ""Tu És Santo"" - com Isadora Pompeo -  e ""Tuas Águas"" - com Gabriela Rocha. Já, Aline Barros, tem em seu repertório sucessos como: ""Autor da Vida"", ""Ressuscita-me"" e ""Sonda-me"".

▸ Letra:

Já posso ouvir os céus cantando
A terra clama pela Sua vinda
Minha alma anseia o nosso encontro
Ele vem, Ele vem

Seus olhos são como de fogo
E os Seus cabelos brancos como a neve
Eu O verei face a face
Ele vem, Ele vem

Ele vem saltando sobre os montes
Ele vem buscar a Sua noiva
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus

Ele vem saltando sobre os montes
Ele vem com toda a Sua glória
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus
Ora vem, Senhor Jesus

Jerusalém, Jerusalém
Cantai, ó Santa Grei
Hosana nas alturas
Hosana ao nosso Rei

Lyrics:

Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow
I don't know just what to do
Am I happy today, am I lonely tomorrow
Everything depends on you

I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin' that everything could be like before

Open your heart and tell me what's wrong
Why can't you talk like you used to do before
I don't know if I'm weak, I don't know if I'm strong
Hey girl, I can't cope anymore

I've been waiting...

Open your heart, let me hear you 
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call 
Open your heart, want to come near you 
Make up your mind, before we lose it all","Therkku Cheemayile - Ajit, Pooja, Sujatha - Attahasam - Tamil Classic Song",UsherVEVO,Finneas O'Connell,Marshmello

Lyrics:

If you take a step towards me, you will take my breath away
So I’ll keep you close, and keep my secret safe
No one else has ever loved me, No one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take
Then I saw the worst was over when I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place
Out of all the past illusions, out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face
 
If You Cried Out For More… If You Reached Out For Me
I Would Run Into The Storm Just To Keep You Here With Me
I Have Gone Beyond My Years- I’ve Wasted Half My Life
But I Found It All In You-
Did I Save You, Cuz I Know You Saved Me Too
 
Let me take a step towards you, let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads
There’s a darkness down inside me that I know we’ll both enjoy
And it’s screaming from within to set it free
I have left this bloody nightmare in my wake but out of sight
All I want is Deviation By Design
Out of all the past confusion, out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours cuz you are mine
 
If You Cried Out For More… If You Reached Out For Me
I Would Run Into The Storm Just To Keep You Here With Me
I Have Gone Beyond My Years- I’ve Wasted Half My Life
But I Found It All In You-
Did I Save You, Cuz I Know You Saved Me Too
SOLO (Tooch)
 
It doesn’t really matter what you do or say
I’m never going anywhere, anyway
Cuz when I’m dying for you, I’ve never felt so alive
 
If You Cried Out For More… If You Reached Out For Me
I Would Run Into The Storm Just To Keep You Here With Me
I Have Gone Beyond My Years- I’ve Wasted Half My Life
But I Found It All In You-
Did I Save You, Cuz I Know You Saved Me Too
 
I know you saved me too…","Faul, Wad Ad, Pnau - Changes (Videoclip)",Gala - Topic,,deadmau5

LYRICS OF BLUE EYES
-----------------------------------------------

""Blue Eyes"", hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, bomb lagdi mennu,bomb lagdi mennu.

Meri Akhon mein dekha kar jab mein baat karta hu, Mein woh londe nhi jo tere sath padta hu, White Ginni laya hu,Tuje pic karlu, Dekh lunga ashiq or teri teacher nu, Leke chalu ride pe fir chath(roof) kholke, Seedhi baat karu ,na karu tolmol ke, Tonight ,i gotta hold you tight, Aaj hogi late phone karke ghar pe bolde.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a menu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Ghar pe chalna hai ya pehle jayegi club, Nhi mera matlab, Ghar ke Club, Tab Lunga left,nahi to right, Club mien hoga shor,baby ghar pe pillow fight You Decide ke kya karna hai, Tujko to jra sa bhi darna hai Champagne ger di hai tune meri pant pe, Kehti hai change karlo hôtel lekar rent pe.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi menu, glossy Lips, uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

Suna tere college mein mere gane ban hai, Padne likhne ka tera na koi plan hai, Pass kradu, Phone Ghumadu ,teri Principal bhi baby YO YO ki fan hai, Teri Principal bhi baby YO YO ki fan hai, Kehndi YO YO Honey singh.

Blue Eyes, hypnotise teri kardi a mennu,
I swear ! choti dress mein bomb lagdi mennu, glossy Lips , uff yeah tricks ,Baby lagdi e killer, Oh Yeah Oh Yeah katal kare tera bomb figure.

From the album ""Destroyer"", here's one of the most beautiful songs of the greatest rock band in the world, KISS!

Lyrics:
""...congressional reports. President Ford says that he's disappointed with Congress's performance. In Detroit, a Pontiac,
Michigan youth was reported dead at the scene of a head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning. The youth was reportedly
driving on the wrong side of the boulevard when he struck a delivery truck and was catapulted through the windshild of his
car. The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured. The identities of both men are being withheld by local police.
County legislatives today are expected to rally to the aid of striking longshoremen in hopes of ending the 9 month
deadlock...""
""...and roll all nite and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all nite and party every day...""

I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do, I got to

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit rock city

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat

Getting late
I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start up the car, and I try to make the midnight show

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat

Movin' fast, doin' 95
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
I hear my song playin' on the radio, it goes

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat

Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die, why

Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet

Get up, everybody's gonna leave their seat",Roxette - Joyride (Official Video),TopicMusicVEVO,Louis Bell,Rihanna

About #Kx5:
Kx5 is a collaboration over a decade and a half in the making. deadmau5 and Kaskade effectively changed the electronic music landscape when they paired together for 2008’s slow-burning “I Remember” and the influence of their follow up “Move For Me” cemented their influence as the standard. Both tracks peaked at No. 1 within a week of one another on Billboard’s Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart. The GRAMMY-nominated artists’ paths crossed again on 2016’s ominous “Beneath with Me” featuring Skylar Grey.  More recently, in July 2021, Kaskade made history as the first public concert performed at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium. The sold-out show featured a surprise set by deadmau5 and had the two artists reuniting again for a set to close the show. As Kx5, deadmau5 and Kaskade are primed to write their own history.  Now the pair officially join forces to form  a unique collaborative union.

Lyrics:

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your B.M.W?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call
Nobody could ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I've got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffin in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue

When she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody could ever hear him call

Lyrics:
Intro:
If I were to go 
Tell me would you 
Notice me 
If I were to go 
Tell me would you
Notice me 

First verse:
24hrs after CS:01 release 
I miss my girl it’s time to hit the streets
I went to check my doc get some vitamin C
You won’t believe what happened to me, I

Drip drip drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it

and I woke up in an ambulance 

If I were to go tell me would you notice me 
If I were to go tell me would you notice me 

Second verse:
64 hours since my baby spoke to me 
He kissed me now I love his dopamine 
I tried go to sleep but my brain on 2cb 
You won't believe what happened to me, I
Drip drip drip with the cold iv 
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it


I been gone moving, high speed now 
That's my song let me hear that bounce 
Latin boy Frida Khalo brow 
Jacquemus jeans Ferragamo brown
Venetian walls with porcelain tiles
286 Donnie Darko town 
If I’m down would you help me out 
If I’m down would you help me out

I had to call you back to tell you that (call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (could have spared my feelings)
I'm not invincible, I'm not invincible (oh)

I had to call you back to tell you that (call me back) 
You could have spared my feelings 
I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible) I'm not invincible 


If I were to go tell me would you notice me 
If I were to go tell me would you notice me

Lyrics:

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
You know you want me
So don’t keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you’re my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you, yeah
But there are mountains (There are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you’re wondering why
Because we’re able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars (Rewrite the stars)
How can you say you’ll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
(The one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me, yeah
When everyone tells us what we can be (Tells us what we can)
And how can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight (Be ours)

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It’s not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

And how do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
And nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

Song Lyrics :

Khwaab hai tu neend hoon main
Dono milen raat bane
Roz yehi maangun dua
Teri meri baat bane

Main rang sharbaton ka
Tu meethe ghaat ka paani
Main rang sharbaton ka
Tu meethe ghaat ka paani
Mujhe khud mein ghol de to
Mere yaar baat ban jaani

Main rang sharbaton ka
Tu meethe ghaat ka paani
Main rang sharbaton ka
Tu meethe ghaat ka paani

Tere khalayon se
Tere khayalon tak
Mera toh hai aana jaana
Mera toh jo bhi hai
Tu hi tha tu hi hai
Baaki jahan hai begaana

Tum ek musafir ho
Main koi raah anjaani
Tum ek musafir ho
Main koi raah anjaani
Man chaha mod de to
Mere yaar baat ban jaani

Rang sharbaton ka
Tu meethe ghaat ka paani...
Main rang sharbaton ka
Tu meethe ghaat ka paani...
Mujhe khud mein ghol de to
Mere yaar baat ban jaani
Rang sharbaton ka
Tu meethe ghaat ka paani...

New Order's 'Regret', which was the first single off of New Order's 1993 album 'Republic' 


Lyrics

Maybe I've forgotten
The name and the address
Of everyone I've ever known,
It's nothing I regret
Save it for another day, 'cause
The school is out 
And the kids have run away
I would like a place I can call my own
Have a conversation on my telephone
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
I would not complain 'bout my wounded heart
I was upset, you see
Almost all the time
You used to be a stranger
Now you are mine
I wouldn't even trust you
I've not that much to give
We're dealing in the limits, 
And we don't know who with
You may think that I'm out of hand
That I'm naive, I'll understand
On this occasion, it's not true
Look at me, I'm not you
I would like a place I can call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
I would not complain 'bout my wounded heart
I was a short fuse
Burning all the time
You were a complete stranger
Now you are mine
I would like a place I can call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
I would not complain 'bout my wounded heart
Just wait 'till tomorrow
I guess that's what they all say
Just before they fall apart

Mujhko itna bataaye koi
Kaise tujh se dil no lagaaye koi

Rabba ne tujhko banaane mein
Kar di hain husn ki ख़ाली tijoriyaan
 
Kaajal ki 
Siyaahi se likhi 
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan 

[ Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

ANTARA
पतझड़ ke mausam mein bhi
रंगी chanaaron jaisi
Jhanke sannaaton mein tu
Veena (वीना) ke taaron jaisi

Sadiyon se bhi Iambi ye
Man ki amaavasein hain
Aur to phuljhadiyon vaale
Tyohaaron jaisi ..

Chanda bhi deevaana hai tera
Jalti hain tujhse
Saari chakoriyaan 

Kaajal ki
Siyaahi se likhi
Hain tu ne jaane
Kitnon ki love storiyaan

[Kesariya tera ishq hai piya
Rang jaaun jo main
Haath lagaaun
Din beete saara teri fikr mein
रैन saari teri खैर manaaun] x2

Letra de «Otras Vidas»

No sé qué es lo que hice en otras vidas.
A quién tuve que salvar 
para que me salvaras tú.
Tal vez curé en la guerra mil heridas
para que hoy en tus brazos 
encontrara la quietud.
No sé si yo te encontré
o si me encontraste tú.

No sé qué fue.
¿Qué es lo que hice? que no lo puedo creer.
Podría jurar que es cosa de Dios
cuando te miro y sólo puedo agradecer
lo que sucedió para poderte merecer,
que aún no lo puedo creer.

No sé qué es lo que hice en otro tiempo
para ahora encontrarme,
en este instante junto a ti.
Tal vez fui el agua que bebiste en el desierto
para que hoy seas quien me vino a revivir.
No sé si yo te encontré
o si me encontraste a mí.

No sé qué fue.
¿Qué es lo que hice? que no lo puedo creer.
Podría jurar que es cosa de Dios
cuando te miro y sólo puedo agradecer
lo que sucedió para poderte merecer,
que aún no lo puedo creer.

No sé qué fue.
¿Qué es lo que hice? que no lo puedo creer.
Podría jurar que es cosa de Dios
cuando te miro y sólo puedo agradecer
lo que sucedió para poderte merecer,
que aún no lo puedo creer,
aún no lo puedo creer.

Lyrics
I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight

LYRICS:
It is my reflection  
But I know it’s not me 
I am becoming something else 
I feel the weight of the key 

This place is falling apart 
There’s no way back 
Passing through the gates 
A new shadow will reveal itself 

The stories have run their course 
None of them make sense 
We’re all someone else’s fool 
Buried in our own debris 

Destroy the things you know 
Destroy yourself in shame 
Before tomorrow comes 
Destroy everything 

Faith alone won’t sustain 
We’re in a state of slow decay 
I hear forgive and forget 
But I see there’s no way 

Seen it through the accolades 
It all should be a great success 

#inflames #metal 
But their are so many burdens 
World is heavy and full of distress

Lyrics: 

Jump down the shelters to get away
The boys are cocking up their guns
Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is, can we all come?

Don't think that we don't know
Don't think that we're not trying
Don't think we move too slow
It's no use after crying

Saying Overkill
Overkill

Lyrics:
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

New Wine
Words and Music by Brooke Ligertwood
© 2017 Hillsong Music Publishing
CCLI: 7102397

VERSE 1:
In the crushing 
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

PRE-CHORUS:
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand
When I trust You I don’t need to understand

CHORUS:
Make me Your vessel
Make me an offering
Make me whatever You want me to be
I came here with nothing
But all You have given me
Jesus bring new wine out of me

VERSE 2:
In the crushing
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I now surrender
You are breaking new ground

VERSE TAG:
You are breaking new ground

BRIDGE:
Where there is new wine
There is new power
There is new freedom
The Kingdom is here
I lay down my old flames
To carry Your new fire today

Available Now: https://mercury-studios.lnk.to/SupertrampParis79 

Supertramp's ""Breakfast In America"" was the biggest selling album in the world in 1979. 

It spawned several hit singles and went on to win two Grammy Awards and sell in excess of 20 million copies. On the album's release Supertramp embarked on a 10 month world tour which arrived in Paris at the end of November. 

These 4 shows from the Pavillon de Paris were all recorded and the last two were filmed. The audio went on to form the basis of the 1980 live album ""Paris"" but the film was never released.  As bonus features, we include five tracks recorded on the night (but for which there is no film) using montage visuals: ""Ain't Nobody But Me"", ""You Started Laughing (When I Held You In My Arms)"", ""A Soapbox Opera"", ""From Now On"" and ""Downstream"".

(Mari Fernandez / Fausto Carvalho/ Magno Neves / Gabriel BK / Lucas Sousa)

Me ligou de madrugada
Disse que tá com saudade
A essa hora é covardia é sacanagem

Sabe que eu não resisto
Corro pra ficar contigo
Meu ponto fraco é sua vozinha no ouvido

Vai bebê
Me pede pra fazer
Aquelas paradas loucas que eu faço com você
Aquelas paradas loucas que eu faço com você

Não tem dia não tem hora e nem lugar
É cama é no chão é no sofá
Quando quiser me usar
Me chama eu vou te amar

Lyrics

Stop, you're not listening
You haven't heard a single word
I know you've been missing me
But when you left, you left me hurt

Shut up and don't talk, I won't be taking your call
It's clear that you're not over me, yeah
I deleted you from my phone 'cause I'm happier on my own
Good luck trying to find somebody

You can sail around the world and cross the seven seas
But you ain't never gonna find someone like me
I'm better off without you now, but honestly
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

Stop reminiscing
What's done is done, no going back
And the clock's start ticking
It was you who left and that's a fact, oh

Shut up and don't talk, I won't be taking your call
It's clear that you're not over me, yeah
I deleted you from my phone 'cause I'm happier on my own
Good luck tryna find somebody

You can sail around the world and cross the seven seas
But you ain't never gonna find someone like me (No, baby)
I'm better off without you now, but honestly
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

You can sail around the world and cross the seven seas
But you ain't never gonna find someone like me
I'm better off without you now, but honestly
Good luck, good luck finding someone like me

Through what has been an equally rewarding and trying career, ask her how she’s come this far and she’ll simply reply, “FAITH.”

With a music career spanning over two decades, Faith has released eight studio albums, with over 18 million albums sold and spawning over 30 singles. Faith Evans is a seven-time Grammy nominee; winning “Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group” in 1998 for “I’ll Be Missing You,” an homage to her late husband and hip-hop legend Notorious B.I.G.",Kenia OS - Malas Decisiones (Letra / Lyrics),Jorge Migoya,,

I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Lyrics:
Teri Meri Gallan Ho Gayi Mashhoor
Kar Na Kabhi Tu Mujhe Nazron Se Door
Kithe Chali Ae Tu Kithe Chali Ae Tu
Kithe Chali Ae Kithe Chali Ae

Jaanda Ae Dil Yeh Toh Jaandi Ae Tu
Tere Bin Main Na Rahun Mere Bina Tu
Kithe Chali Ae Tu Kithe Chali Ae Tu
Kithe Chali Ae, Jaan Chali Ae

Kaatun Kaise Raatan Oh Saawre?
Jiya Nahi Jaata Sunn Baawre?

Ke Raataan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re
Ke Raatan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re

Cham Cham Cham Ambran De Taare
Kehnde Ne Sajjna
Tu Hi Chan Mere Is Dil Da
Mann Le Ve Sajjna

Tere Bina Mera Howe Na Guzara
Chhad Ke Na Jawin Mainu
Tu Hi Hai Sahara

Kaatun Kaise Raatan Oh Saawre?
Jiya Nahi Jaata Sunn Baawre?

Ke Raatan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re
Ke Raataan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re

Teri Meri Gallan Ho Gayi Mashhoor
Kar Na Kabhi Tu Mainu Nazron Se Door
Pichhe Chali Ae Tere Pichhe Chali Ae
Tere Pichhe Chali Ae

Jaanda Ae Dil Yeh Toh Jaandi Ae Tu
Tere Bina Main Na Rahun Mere Bina Tu
Kithe Chali Ae Tu Kithe Chali Ae Tu
Kithe Chali Ae

Kaatun Kaise Raatan Oh Saawre?
Jiya Nahi Jaata Sunn Baawre?

Ke Raatan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re
Ke Raatan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re

Ke Raatan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re
Ke Raatan Lambiyan Lambiyan Re
Kate Tere Sangeyan Sangeyan Re

Lyrics:
You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I call you mine

 ABOUT IRON MAIDEN:
Iron Maiden are an institution. Over the course of six decades they have come to embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an adventure like no other.

The band’s immense discography includes the studio albums ‘The Number Of The Beast’, ‘Piece Of Mind’, ‘Powerslave, ‘Somewhere In Time’, ‘Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son’, ‘Fear Of The Dark’, ‘The Final Frontier’ and ‘The Book Of Souls’ which have spawned many classic hits as ‘The Trooper’, ‘Wasted Years’, ‘Hallowed Be Thy Name’, ‘Wasting Love’, ‘Run To The Hills’, ‘Aces High’, ‘Rime Of The Ancient Mariner’ and ‘2 Minutes to Midnight’.

LYRICS
Undo these chains, my friend. I’ll show you the rage I’ve hidden.
Perish the Sacrament. Swallow, but nothing’s forgiven.
You and I can’t decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amends… some of us are destined to be outlived.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father.
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother.
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.
In between the lens in light, you’re not what you seem.

STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil…
I’m Not Your Devil Anymore

Your Station- Is Abandoned- Fool You ‘cause I know what you’ve done
Sensation- Depravation- You should’ve burned when you turned on everyone

SO STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we’ve let it come to this
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Oh, when all that’s left does not make sense
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
I know you’ll find your answers in the end
STEP INSIDE/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You’ll realize I’m not your Devil… anymore

SO STEP INSIDE/ STEP INSIDE
SEE THE DEVIL IN I/ SEE THE DEVIL IN I","Luciano Pereyra, Los Ángeles Azules - Una Mujer Como Tú",Weedy Weed Smoker,,Pharrell Williams

Es influencia de haber nacido en la ciudad capital de Bogotá, Colombia. 

El estilo del álbum incluye una mezcla de vallenato, pop latino y la música disco en una fusión única. Al mismo tiempo, nos muestra una gran dualidad en sus letras y de una profundad melancólica. 

Su debut en las listas de discos latinos estaba en la posición #70 en su semana de lanzamiento. En la lista de álbumes tropicales alcanzó el número #9.

 ARROYITO
Letra

Amaneció, y me encontré con que emprendiste un largo viaje,
Mi corazón se te escapó del equipaje
Y se quedó fue pa llenarme de recuerdos

Amaneció, y el gallo viejo que cantaba en la ventana,
Hoy no cantó pues tu no abriste la mañana,
Y hasta el viento se devolvió porque no estaba

Eres el arroyito que baña mi cabaña,
Eres el negativo de la foto de mi alma,
Eres agua bendita que crece en mi cultivo,
Eres ese rayito que me calienta el nido

Atardeció, y el corazón abre su álbum en silencio,
Un acordeón le va imprimiendo los recuerdos
Y hace también una canción para que vuelvas

Atardeció, y ya se va la claridad de mi cabaña,
No tengo luz en los rincones de mi alma
Pues ya no tengo todo lo que llevas dentro

Eres el arroyito que baña mi cabaña,
Eres el negativo de la foto de mi alma,
Eres agua bendita que crece en mi cultivo,
Eres ese rayito que me calienta el nido

Yo sólo quiero ser el dueño de tu amor,
Yo sólo quiero ser el dueño de tu vida,
Para encontrarte y devolverte el corazón
Y me acompañes por el resto de mi vida

Eres el arroyito que baña mi cabaña,
Eres el negativo de la foto de mi alma,
Eres agua bendita que crece en mi cultivo,
Eres ese rayito que me calienta el nido.

Lyrics: 
I should've stayed with you last night
Instead of going out to find trouble
That's just trouble (Mmm)
I think I run away sometimes
Whenever I get too vulnerable
That's not your fault (Yeah)

See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, Heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

And every time it gets too real
And every time I feel us sabotaging
I start running (Yeah, eh)
And every time I push away
I really wanna say that I'm sorry (Yeah)
But I say nothing (Yeah)

See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, Heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise
I wanna show you that you're my only
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise, through the sunrise
Oh-oh-oh-oh, Heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me (Me, yeah)
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now

Lyrics:
This world is not what it was meant to be
All this pain, all this suffering
There's a better place
Waiting for me
In Heaven

Every tear will be wiped away
Every sorrow and sin erased
We'll dance on seas of amazing grace
In Heaven
In Heaven

I'm goin' home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I'm in your open arms
Where I belong
Home

Lay down my burdens, I lay down my past
I run to Jesus, no turning back
Thank God Almighty, I'll be free at last
In Heaven
In Heaven

I'm goin' home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I'm in your open arms
Where I belong

Blinded eyes
Will finally see
The dead will rise
On the shores of eternity
The trump will sound
The angels will sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I am
Goin' home
Where the streets are golden
Every chain is broken
Oh I wanna go
Oh I wanna go
Home
Where every fear is gone
I'm in your open arms
Where I belong
Where I belong

I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home
I'm on my way home
I'm goin' home

BIO
3x Grammy award-winning superstar, Lizzo has become a household name with over 5 billion global streams and a platinum selling debut album to date. With the help of anthemic smash hits like the 7x Platinum “Truth Hurts,” the 3x Platinum “Good As Hell,” and the 2x Platinum “Juice,” Lizzo released her Nice Life Recording Company/Atlantic Records debut album CUZ I LOVE YOU on April 19th 2019, debuting at #6 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart and spending 24 consecutive weeks in the chart’s Top 10. “Truth Hurts” became the longest running #1 by a solo female rap artist in history after spending seven weeks atop the charts. Since the release of the meteoric CUZ I LOVE YOU, Lizzo has been named both Time Magazine and Entertainment Weekly’s 2019 Entertainer of the Year as well as gracing the covers of Rolling Stone, Billboard’s GRAMMY Preview Issue, British Vogue, Elle’s Women In Music Issue, and many others.  Additionally, Lizzo kicked off 2020 with a showstopping opening performance at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY awards and took home three big wins, in addition to being the most-nominated artist of the year. 2020 has also seen her win the awards for Best Female R&B/Pop Artist at the 2020 B.E.T Awards and both “Entertainer of the Year” and “Outstanding Video” at the 2020 NAACP Awards. Her list of high profile TV performances also include the 2019 American Music Awards, VMAs, B.E.T Awards and Saturday Night Live, in addition to in depth profiles on CBS This Morning’s GRAMMY primetime special and CBS Sunday Morning. Now, Lizzo returns with her first new single in two years- the highly-anticipated “Rumors"" featuring Cardi B.

LYRICS

I am a dominant gene, live as I die
Never say forever 'cause forever's a lie
I can see right through you, so I can ignore you
The story changes but the ending won't bore you

I tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
You didn't listen, so they threw you away
Now all you do is talk
I don't wanna hear your bullshit
Is this what you want?

This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see, we're all clearly alive

We know where you are and we're coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers, 30/30-150 hates

In my own peculiar way, I feel mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where but I still don't know the when

You wanna live in a one-sided world
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now it's the Grand Facade
I don't wanna be an angel
I just want to be God

They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see, we're all clearly alive

We know where you are and we're coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers, 30/30-150 hates, hates

I am a fucking machine fueled by the past
Memory's a memory until it's a fact
I can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
But I got too many grudges to hold

I saw a lot of people die in the end
I never want to walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don't wanna have it all
I just wanna have enough

This is where it begins
And this is where it ends
And this is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see, we're all clearly alive

We know where you are and were coming
Let's see you say that shit to our face
30/30-150 remembers, 30/30-150 hates

He turned up in a tank top fresh off of 9 months on his own in the Himalayas. The guy is a different one. In the most beautiful way. So I got together a bunch of friends at hackney wick  station one eve not long after and we tried to make our own version. And big shouts out to all those lovelies who came! This is what we ended up with. The idea was that the video would come first and then I’d make a song to the video. So this is that. There’s one from the day time too which I’m workin on now.

Kyle was this guy who I found at an open mic poetry night and he did this unbelievably beautiful thing about meeting this girl for the first time. 

Describing the bar as tho it was like a war zone of like absolute chaos. 

The line ‘in this smoking chaos our shoulder blades kissed’ is as close to perfection as 8 words can get.

Kyle was also then super sweet about it when I told him I’d re pitched him into a whole damn song lol 😬🙏🤗🙏

I think let’s all be more like Kyle

Letra  🎵

Debes buscarte un nuevo amor
Que no guarde sus problemas
Que no sea como yo
A la hora de la cena

Que cuando muera de celos
Jamás te diga nada
Que no tenga, como yo
Tantas heridas en el alma

Debes buscarte un nuevo amor
Que sea todo un caballero
Que tenga una profesión
Sin problemas de dinero

Sea amigo de tus amigos
Simpatice con tus padres
Y que nunca hable de más
Que no pueda lastimarte

Pero, vida
Me conoces desde siempre
Y ahora tengo que decir
Siempre digo lo que siento

Que no vas a encontrar nunca
Con quién mirar las estrellas
Alguien que pueda bajarte
Con un beso una de ellas
Alguien que te haga sentir
Tocar el cielo con las manos
Alguien que te haga volar como yo
No vas a encontrarlo

Que no vas a encontrar nunca
A alguien que te ame de veras
Alguien que te haga llorar
De tanto amar, de tantos besos
Alguien con quién caminar
Como dos locos, de la mano
Alguien que te haga vibrar como yo
No vas a encontrarlo

Pero la realidad
Es que no hay nadie como yo
No hay nadie
Tal vez, Román, no más

Que no vas a encontrar nunca
Con quién mirar las estrellas
Alguien que pueda bajarte
Con un beso una de ellas
Alguien que te haga sentir
Tocar el cielo con las manos
Alguien que te haga volar como yo
No vas a encontrarlo

Que no vas a encontrar nunca
A alguien que te ame de veras
Alguien que te haga llorar
De tanto amar, de tantos besos
Alguien con quién caminar
Como dos locos, de la mano
Alguien que te haga vibrar como yo
No vas a encontrarlo

Debes buscarte un nuevo amor
Que no guarde sus problemas
Que no sea como yo
A la hora de la cena

Que cuando muera de celos
Jamás te diga nada
Que no tenga, como yo
Tantas heridas en el alma

Por Eso Te Amo: http://smarturl.it/rrporesovid 
Hoy Es Un Buen Día: http://smarturl.it/rrhoyesunvid   

LETRA

Esta noche quiero obsequiarte algo, 
no se trata ni de flores ni regalos. 
Voy a tratarte de explicar, hablarte con sinceridad, 
para que sepas lo que traigo yo entre manos.

Primero quiero agradecerte tanto.
Me has amado, me has llenado, me has cambiado 
y ya te debes de enterar, lo que yo pienso en realidad, 
cuando por tonto a veces me quedo callado.

Quiero caminar de tu mano lo que me resta del camino.
Que los cumpleaños que me faltan siempre los pases conmigo. 
Te digo que no estoy jugando 
cuando te digo que ¡te amo, te amo, te amo, te amo!
Y quiero caminar de tu mano, hasta que estemos muy viejitos.
Ya sé que habrá unos días malos, esperemos que poquitos.
Si aún no me has entendido: Quiero que tus hermosos ojos 
los hereden nuestros niños.

Una vez un sabio me dijo: Muchacho, 
cuando alguien te guste fíjate en sus manos, 
pues con el paso del tiempo, menos van a besarse
y más van a tomarse de las manos.

Quiero caminar de tu mano lo que me resta del camino.
Que los cumpleaños que me faltan siempre los pases conmigo. 
Te digo que no estoy jugando 
cuando te digo que ¡te amo, te amo, te amo, te amo!

Tú para mí eres lo primero. 
Siempre te lleno de besos,
pero ahora yo quiero describirte lo que siento.

Quiero caminar de tu mano lo que me resta del camino.
Que los cumpleaños que me faltan siempre los pases conmigo. 
Te digo que no estoy jugando 
cuando te digo que ¡te amo, te amo, te amo, te amo!
Y quiero caminar de tu mano, hasta que estemos muy viejitos.
Ya sé que habrá unos días malos, esperemos que poquitos.
Si no me has entendido: Quiero que tus hermosos ojos 
los hereden nuestros niños.

Si aún no me has entendido: Quiero que tus hermosos ojos 
los hereden nuestros niños.

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator, Ty Dolla $ign & DJ Drama]
Something real, yeah
Baby
Hold on now, we don't do that back
Haha, that's my pick up line and shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got your bitch movin'
Call me when you get lost

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & Ty Dolla $ign]
Aw, you look malnourished (Malnourished)
Let's get some bread, fry the egg yolk and drown it in syrup (Drown it in syrup)
You pick a spot, I pick a tail number and we can be tourists (Ooh, yeah)
Let's go to Cannes and watch a couple indie movies that you never heard of (Baby)
Listen to bands, groove and we dance
Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (In the wind)
We can switch off
I can show you how you can really exfoliate skin
If you got a man, you should cut him off
Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (Run off)
We can sit and talk
You can tell me everything that's on your chest, baby, get it off
You are my type, you a bright light
I'm like a moth, this is not a game (This is not a game)
But before we start (Before I say)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator with Ty Dolla $ign & Ty Dolla $ign]
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)
(Oh, what's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Tell me)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)
(Oh, what's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Oh, girl)
Yeah

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Tyler, The Creator & Ty Dolla $ign]
What is your name, what do you bring? (Yeah)
I think that I got what you need
And I'm willin' to do anything that you please (Baby)
I'm tryna get down to the root of the apple
The deepest I could in them jeans
McLaren, like Sonic, can't speed, no
No, you can't hit my lean, no (Baby)
Baby, tell me where the peace go, 'cause I'm lost
Your body compared to the fashion
I hope you ain't proud of the shit that I bought (Baby)
'Cause money, it don't mean a thing
I tell you the times that I take you out
One minute, it's a beautiful scene
And it'll probably end with me takin' off, oh
Oh, think so, 'cause I move fast (Oh, me)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator with Ty Dolla $ign & Ty Dolla $ign]
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)
(Oh, what's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Tell me)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Tell me)
(Oh, what's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Yeah)
Y, yeah, yeah, oheah

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator, Ty Dolla $ign & DJ Drama]
Since when did I bring a C5?
Oh, I wanna know your name
I feel like I heard your name
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh
Stop playin' and let me pay your momma debt off, haha

LYRICS 

The hard days are nearly over
and we’ve been hanging on
It feels like we’re getting closer
to dawn

We took the long way up to heaven
and got blinded by the lights
but as long as we’re together
I know it will be alright

I see a better day
I see a better day for you, for you and me
I see a better day
Yeah everything is gonna change for you and me

I knew we were gonna make it
I never had a doubt
Soon we’ll be feeling weightless
like clouds

We took the long way up to heaven
and got blinded by the lights
but as long as we’re together
I know it will be alright

I see a better day
I see a better day for you, for you and me
I see a better day
Yeah everything is gonna change for you and me",Kenny Chesney - All the Pretty Girls (Official Video),,Louis Bell,Soccer Mommy

With the new album, Sonder, Dermot Kennedy admits he’s never related to a word more. Sonder, “the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own,” encapsulates universal themes of love, loss & hope, with the platinum-selling artist evolving into an even more expressive and powerful storyteller

Directed by Paul Gore for Iconoclast UK
Produced by Lana Salfiti and Ayo Davis

‘Something to Someone’ Lyrics: 

There’s lessons in love sometimes 
The heart is but a winding road,
So this story goes.

I get scared of the dark and I,
I never even noticed rooms
Were made bright by you.

Oh you loved me more than anyone,
Yea we were up so high 

We were lost when we were young but, 
You were mine

Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could’ve known 
That I should hold on tight 
To every single word 
To every summer night
I wish I could’ve known 
That forever was a lie 

But once upon a time 
I was something to someone 
Once upon a time 
I was something to someone 

See your shape under gold street lights
But every time I’m close you move 
And I’m just left with the truth 

Oh you loved me more than anyone,
Yea we were up so high 

We were lost when we were young but, 
You were mine

Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could’ve known 
That I should hold on tight 
To every single word 
To every summer night
I wish I could’ve known 
That forever was a lie 

But once upon a time 
I was something to someone 
Once upon a time 
I was something to someone 

Something to you
Something to you 

Once upon a time
You were by my side
I wish I could’ve known 
That I should hold on tight 
To every single word 
To every summer night
I wish I could’ve known 
That forever was a lie 

But once upon a time 
I was something to someone 
Once upon a time 
I was something to someone 

Something to you
Something to you

The Highs & The Lows lyrics


The highs and the lows
The highs
The lows
I’m an emotional roller coaster 
With highs so high, I could put Bol Bol on a poster
But when the bread get low like four loaves in a toaster
Oh the shoulders can get cold as ten toes in Nova Scotia
Some days I hold a grudge
Some days I Holy Ghost her
Some days I just ghost her
Some days I’m supposed to
The crib feel like a gunfight but them strollers that’s the holster
We could make amends over old memes and mimosas
My mama know I ain’t make my bed
But Ima lay in it
Whether it’s sandpaper, suede, linen
Whether I’m alone or Creole lady marmalade-ing it
The same pajamas I was afraid in
I boogeyman slayed
My blankets concealed my blade in it
Emotional seesaw
With two fat motherfuckers with strong knees in free fall
It’s cloudy with a chance of meatballs
I checked the weather
I gave all my vices a call
Let’s get together
To talk about the highs and lows
The ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you’d always come around
Come around
Come around
Come around
Come around
To work out the highs and lows
The ups and downs
No need to hide disguises coming down
Go and get high
I promise you’re coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
It’s hard to keep your eyes on the road
And you feel your back’s on the ropes
You gotta take the highs with the lows
You gotta take the highs with the lows
You’re lost and you’re running out of hope
Looking for the best way to cope
Just know we all been there before
You gotta take the highs with the lows
BadMON
I was feeling lifeless
I had to cut my vices
Now the feeling that I feel is priceless
Inner spirit want me to be righteous
But I know I might just relapse
Get sucked in these devices
Got so used to feedback
I couldn’t tell what mines is
Sometimes all the outside noise just really blinds us
Beware
Believe none of what you see and half of what you hear
The best things in life on the opposite side of fear
I swear I see it clear like after the storm
Still you can’t stop the rain like the Loose Ends song
My word is bond like James
Yo I couldn’t complain
Cause even when I did niggas really couldn’t feel my pain
That’s the type of shit to drive a nigga insane
Wanna be numb now your thumb back flicking the flame
Back to square one
Trying to overcome what you became
Like they was right
I guess you’re never gonna change
When It’s hard to keep your eyes on the road
You start to feel your back on the ropes
You gotta take the highs with the lows
You gotta take the highs with the lows
Lost and you’re running out of hope
And you’re looking for the best way to cope
Just know we all been there before
You gotta take the highs with the lows
To talk about the highs with the lows
The ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you’d always come around
Come around
Come around
Come around
Come around
To work out the highs and lows
The ups and downs
No need to hide disguises coming down
Go and get high
I promise you’re coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Coming down
Chano

JOZIF BADMON
Yes Yes
You done know this
Big up to the youth dem
Ah the youth dem worldwide
Ah the youth dem the truth dem
Yes and The most high
Praise the most high

Bırakalım onları canım
Konuşalım senli benli
Arada bi' estir fanı
Yaz günü terli terli

Aaayy 
Yalansız dolansız, söyle neyinim ben?
Sen arandın, arandın
Şimdi gerilme, yok!

Deli duman alabora kalbin
Yel arıyo', sebebime talip
Kumaşı da nereli bilinmez
Yanmaz ütülenmez

Kimlere kalmış o bahçen?
Çalısı dikenime müşahit
Bu kadarı nefretin, aşktır
Yıkanmaz çitilenmez

Hem durma kaşın
Hem sabrımı taşır
Derim dul, alışır
Böyle kalınlaşır

Hem durma kaşın
Hem bardağımı taşır
Derim dul, alışır
Böyle kalınlaşır 
 
Deli duman alabora kalbin
Yel arıyo', sebebime talip
Kumaşı da nereli bilinmez
Yanmaz ütülenmez

Kimlere kalmış o bahçen?
Çalısı dikenime müşahit
Bu kadarı nefretin, aşktır
Yıkanmaz çitilenmez

Lyrics

Between the eyes of love I call your name
Behind those guarded walls I used to go
Upon a summer wind there's a certain melody
Takes me back to the place that I know
Down on the beach
The secrets of the summer I will keep
The sands of time will blow a mystery
No-one but you and I
Underneath that moonlit sky
Take me back to the place that I know
On the beach
Forever in my dreams my heart will be
Hanging on to this sweet memory
A day of strange desire
And a night that burned like fire
Take me back to the place that I know
On the beach

もうきっと多分大丈夫　どこが痛いか分かったからね
自分で涙拾えたら　いつか魔法に変えられる

ほんの少し忘れていたね　とても長かった　ほんの少し
お日様がない時は　クレヨンで世界に創り出したでしょう

正義の味方には見つけて貰えなかった類
探しに行かなくちゃ　呼び合い続けた　あの声だよ

溜め息にもなれなかった　名前さえ持たない思いが
心の一番奥の方　爪を立てて　堪えていたんだ
触れて確かめられたら　形と音が分かるよ
伝えたい言葉はいつだって　そうやって見つけてきた


振り返れば途切れずに　歪な線を描く足跡
悲しいくらい分かりやすく　いつもここに向けて伸びる

大切にするのは下手でも　大切だって事は分かっている
せめてその白い手紙が　正しく届きますように

考え過ぎじゃないよ　そういう闇の中にいて
勇気の眼差しで　次の足場を探しているだけ

解き放て　あなたの声で　光る羽根与えた思いを
その足が向かうべき先へ　そうしなきゃ見えなかった未来へ
諦めなかった事を　誰よりも知っているのは
羽ばたいた言葉のひとつひとつ　必ず届きますように


もう一度　もう一度　クレヨンで　好きなように
もう一度　さあどうぞ　好きな色で　透明に
もう一度　もう一度　クレヨンで　この世界に
今こそ　さあどうぞ　魔法に変えられる

ああ、なぜ、どうして、と繰り返して　それでも続けてきただろう
心の一番奥の方　涙は炎　向き合う時が来た
触れて確かめられたら　形と音をくれるよ
あなたの言葉がいつだって　あなたを探してきた

そうやって見つけてきた

Ela me deu o seu amor, eu tomei
No dia 16 de maio, viajei
Espaçonave atropelado, procurei
O meu amor aperreado
Apenas apanhei na beira-mar
Um táxi pra estação lunar
Apanhei na beira mar
Um táxi.
Bela linda criatura, bonita
Nem menina, nem mulher
Tem espelho no seu rosto de neve
Nem menina, nem mulher
Apenas apanhei na beira-mar
Um táxi pra estação lunar
Apanhei na beira mar
Um táxi...
Pela sua cabeleira, vermelha
Pelos raios desse sol, lilás
Pelo fogo do seu corpo, centelha
Belos raios desse sol
Apenas apanhei na beira-mar
Um táxi pra estação lunar
Apanhei na beira mar
Um táxi...
Bela linda criatura, bonita
Nem menina, nem mulher
Tem espelho no seu rosto de neve
Nem menina, nem mulher
Apenas apanhei na beira-mar
Um táxi pra estação lunar

Lyrics:
En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición

Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo baby estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Que me quede otro round
tanto que me a rogado
Ya lo tengo oficiado
Yo te observado
No aguanta se adapta me dice
No quiero que termines
Es un misterio pero no de cine
En la noche soy yo la que define
Todo lo que va a pasar
a mi no me tienes que mandar

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

A ella le gusta cuando bajo Downtown
Me pide que me quede ahi enviciado
Le digo mami estoy interesado
Si quieres yo quédo otro round

Uh se que me quieres ver
Bajando por toda tu piel
Uh se que quieres que me quede
Enredarte en mis piernas es lo que quieres 

No se vale el empate, esto es hasta darle jaque mate
Hasta que uno de los dos se mate
Si quieres yo bajo y de una me pongo pal' trabajo
Suelta el estrés, baby, yo te relajo
Se pone bella, me dice que ya
Sigue ahí, que la tengo viendo las estrellas
Se me acelera, hasta abajo se va
Y como ella lo hace, no lo hace cualquiera
En su cuerpo puedo ver la definición
Se ve que lo trabaja eres motivación
Le pedi que me ayude con una mission
Que me llena entera de satisfacción

A mi me gusta cuando baja Downtown
Le pido que se quede ahi enviciado
Me dice baby sueno interesado
Si quieres ven y quédate otro round

Lyrics:
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
[English translation: ""How could it be true?""]

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
[""The beautiful island""]

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
[""He told you, 'I love you.'""]
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Te dijo te amo
El dijo que te ama
[""He said he loves you""]

La isla bonita
Your Spanish lullaby

Up to that point, Summer had mainly been associated with disco songs but this song also showed a significant rock direction, including a guitar solo by ex-Doobie Brother and Steely Dan guitarist Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter. It is one of her most popular songs, based on the performance on the Billboard Hot 100...
Sittin' here, eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight

(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Got to have a love tonight

(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
Hot love
Lookin' for hot love

(Hot hot hot hot stuff)
(Hot hot hot)
(Hot hot hot hot stuff)
(Hot hot hot)

How's 'bout some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
Gimme little hot stuff baby this evenin'
Hot stuff baby
Gonna need your love tonight

(Hot stuff)
I need hot love
Lookin' for hot love
Wanna have hot love

Sittin' here eating my heart no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers baby
I'm bound to find somebody home

Gonna have some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby tonight
Looking for my hot stuff, baby this evenin'
Need some loving baby

👇 LETRA de ""SOY SABALERO"" - Los Palmeras 👇

No hace falta que les digan que soy raza
Por mi piel escapa el alma sabalera,
Sangre y luto es el color de mi bandera
Y a los negros yo los llevo aquí en el alma,
Es el negro un sentimiento que se lleva de verdad
Y que late al compás del corazón,
Si ganara yo al infierno por ser negro y nada mas
Moriré llevando negro el corazón,

Sabale, sabale, la culpa de este pueblo sabalero,
Sabale, sabale, que todo el mundo grite dale negro!
Aee ea yo soy sabalero, Aee ea  sabalero, Sabalero!
Aeea yo soy sabalero, Aee ea  sabalero, Sabalero!

He nacido en las orillas roja y negras,
Yo me entiendo con la gente sabalera,
Soy amiga del ciruja y del maestro
Con el sordo y con el punga yo me encuentro,
Y en mi casa se codea la pobreza y el señor
Con el cura el judío y el pastor
Y aunque me ganara el cielo por cambiarme de color
Moriré llevando negro el corazón.

Sabale, sabale, la culpa de este pueblo sabalero,
Sabale, sabale, que todo el mundo grite dale negro!
Aee ea yo soy sabalero, Aee ea  sabalero, Sabalero!
Aeea yo soy sabalero, Aee ea  sabalero, Sabalero!
Aee ea yo soy sabalero, Aee ea  sabalero, Sabalero!
Aeea yo soy sabalero, Aee ea  sabalero, Sabalero!
Aee ea yo soy sabalero, Aee ea  sabalero, Sabalero!

Lyrics
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
let me take you past our satellites

You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy gray I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'cause I'm not thinking straight
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do, like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do, yeah
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

I'll let you set the pace
'cause I'm not thinking straight
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do, like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do, yeah
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do

All For Us Lyrics:
Oh
Taking it all for us
Taking it all
Taking it all for us
Oh
Doing it all for love
Doing it all
Doing it all for love
Taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, eh
Too much in my system (famine, famine)
Money MIA (pockets hella empty)
Mama making ends meet (making ends meet)
Working like a slave (Mississippi, aye-aye)
Daddy ain't at home, no (Father, Father)
Gotta be a man (Michael Corleone)
Do it for my homegrowns (sisters, brothers)
Do it for the fam (yeah, so tell 'em Labby)
Ey! (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just for your love, yeah, I'll
Give you the world
Mona Lisa's smile
Hey (oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I'll do 25 to life
If it makes me a king
A star in your eyes
Guilty or innocent
My love is infinite, I'm giving it
No need for prisoners
Bitch please, hands up, this is a stick up 'cause I'm
Hey, yeah
I'm taking it
Yeah-eh
I'm taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, eh
Guess you figured my two times two
Always equates to one
Dreamers are selfish
When it all comes down to it
I hope one of you come back to remind me of who I was
When I go disappearing
Into that good night (good night)
I'm taking it all for us, all
Doing it all for love
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, eh",Alessia Cara - Make It To Christmas,,Yeti Beats,Flume

In a live shooting from the imposing Salzburg Cathedral, Claudio Abbado conducted an all-Mozart programme, honouring his predecessor both by the careful selection of the music and the singers. The Berliner Philharmoniker, conducted by Claudio Abbado, performed Mozart's Requiem in D minor, KV 626, among other works. Soprano Rachel Harnisch appeared as the soloist on the two complementing arias “Betracht dies mein Herz und frage mich” and Laudate Dominum. Featuring soprano Karita Mattila, contralto Sara Mingardo, tenor Michael Schade and bass baritone Bryn Terfel as soloists of the Requiem. A performance that in every respect met Karajan's own high artistic standards.

Mera, dime Casper! Brrrr

ANUEL AA
La G en toa’ las cortas 
Te prendemos las Jordan en el casco 
Y te dejamos el pelo rojo como Rodman,
Tu cara en un charco de sangre, 
Los kilos en el aire, 
Mas rifles y mas putas cuando corone en Los  United, 
Mera dime Casper, los intocables, oite lambebicho!  

CORO
De presidentes muertos tengo toa’ las caras 
La guagua esta blinda cabron prueba y dispara 
Tu puta viaja cada vez que se me para y me dice que anda en dinero y que no le para (X2)

ANUEL AA
Gorra espeta Maison Margiela 
el micro en la sudadera caja de tiro con cojones en bolsa de basura negra
Se robaron diez trabajos y dijeron que se cayeron 
Se murieron, les borre la cara y les guindaba el cuero, 
El de forense ta’ traumao’ por como los dos muertos se vieron 
Como una escena violenta en la noticia lo describieron, 
Cabron me cago en tu mai y en la de to’ tu corrillo entero, 
Les puse un kilo por casco 
Hay guerra y los contratos se abrieron 
El dinero no para de entrar esperando los kilos en el muelle 
Dios mio que no salga mal 
Tu puta textiando y llamándo al cuadro 
To’ el mundo y me voy a chingar y la pongo a mamar 
Yo se de asesinos que hoy dia por redes lo unico que hacen twittear

IMAGINE
Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try
No hell below us, above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today...

Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace...

Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger - a brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world... 

You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us and the world will live as one

written by John Lennon & Yoko Ono 

ABOUT IMAGINE
John: ‘Imagine’ is a song conceived in my head without melody. The first verse came to me very quickly in the form of a childlike street chant ‘da da da da da dee dee da dee da ee a eeeh’. The piano intro I’ve had hanging around in my head for a few years – the chords and melody followed naturally from this. 

The middle eight was ‘conceived’ to finish off the song. I think it works as a song. Of course, there is always room for improvement – otherwise I wouldn’t make any more. The third verse came to me in an eight-seater plane. It’s a song for children.

Yoko: ‘Cloud Piece’: ‘Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in.’ This is not a piece of poetry. Poetry to me is nouns or adjectives. This is verbs. And you have to do them. These are all instructions and when you just do it, then you start to understand it.

John: ‘Imagine’ was inspired by Yoko’s Grapefruit. There’s a lot of pieces in it saying like ‘Imagine this’ or ‘Imagine that’. If you get a copy of Grapefruit and look through, you’ll see where I was influenced by her. ‘Imagine’ could never have been written without her. And I know she helped on a lot of the lyrics but I wasn’t man enough to let her have credit for it. So that song was actually written by John & Yoko, but I was still selfish enough and unaware enough to take her contribution without acknowledging it. The song itself expresses what I’d learned through being with Yoko and my own feelings on it. It should really have said ‘Lennon/Ono’ on that song, because she contributed a lot of that song.

Alan White (drummer): Every song we did on Imagine, John would make us read the lyrics and insist that we understood the meaning of the song before started playing it. That had quite an impact for me.

Klaus Voormann (bass): When we played ‘Imagine’ and heard the lyrics, the possibility that this was going to be such a big song was apparent. It definitely was. I even thought I didn’t want to play on it because it was so amazing with just John playing piano. It was so true and honest. That would have been enough. I hope you’ve got a version of just John playing it.

Phil McDonald (engineer): ‘Imagine’ was one of the easiest tracks to record, almost all live, in a few takes. We mixed the track at Tittenhurst and Phil Spector added strings on top of the stereo tape in the USA.

Yoko: John and I were both artists and we were living together, so we inspired each other. And the song ‘Imagine’ embodied what we believed together at the time. John and I met – he comes from the West and I come from the East – and still we are together. We have this oneness and ‘the whole world would eventually become one’ is the sense that we will all be café-au-lait colour and we will all be very happy together. All these instructions are for people for how to spend eternity, because we have lots of time.

John: If you can imagine a world of peace, if you can imagine a world with no denominations of religion – not without religion, whatever religion is – but without this divisive ‘My god is bigger than your god’ business.... Then, if you can imagine the possibility, then it can be true.

Yoko: ‘Imagine’ is a complete vision. A succinct bible of truth. It will start to unfold as you believe in it. The film? Well, it just happened naturally. I was well aware of the symbolism of everything – closing and then opening the shutters to let the light in. It’s rather personal, but I had a definite reason why I smiled at the end, in addition to loving being next to John.

- LYRICS - 

Bring me back to life
Never let me go 
Your troubles and your strife
I saw them 
Take me by the hand 
As we cross through battlefields
Nobody understands
‘Cause there's nobody at the wheel 
 
Beautiful James 
I don’t want to wake you 
Beautiful James 
I don’t want to wake you 
 
Everybody lies 
One hundred times a day 
The silence in your eyes 
Is far too rare to give away 
And it's exactly why I stay 
 
Beautiful James 
I don’t want to wake you 
Beautiful James 
I don’t want to wake you  
 
I don’t want to wake you
Beautiful James 
Don’t want to wake you        
 
I don't want to wake you
Don’t want to wake you 
Beautiful James 
Don’t want to wake you
I don’t want to wake you 
 
Though I may have to 
I may have to 
I may have to 
 
Beautiful James 
I don’t wanna wake you 
Don’t wanna wake you
Beautiful James
Don’t wanna wake you
I don’t wanna wake you 
Don’t wanna wake you
Beautiful James 
Don’t wanna wake you
I don’t wanna wake you","PA QUE BAILE - DJ ALEX, THE LA PLANTA | E8 (Video Oficial)",,Yeti Beats,Phoebe Bridgers

#SevenNationArmy #TheGlitchMob #TheWhiteStripes
 
Lyrics:
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
 
And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""
 
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
 
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""
 
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
 
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""",N.I.B. - Black Sabbath,,Louis Bell,Bon Iver

[Intro: Darell]
Oh-oh
Este es el verdadero remix

[Chencho, Darell]
Dice que no le falta nada
Está creci'a, tiene to' lo que soñó (Pa’ que sepa')
No tiene hora de llegada
A la nena buena ella le dijo ""Adiós"" (Ratatatá)
Y ahora quiere vivir lo que antes no vivió
Y ahora pide sexo y lo mismo quiero yo

[Cauty]
'Ta to' Gucci, ey
A ella le gusta fumar la cripa
Pero siempre en pipa y pa' lo munchies sushi, ey
Me salió media bicha la tipa, pero lo amerita

Así que 'tá to Gucci, ey
Como el father yo le digo ""cuchi-cuchi"", ey-ey
Tiene una amiga media buchi, ey
Así que si pa'l threesome se activa, má' na’ se diga

[Brytiago]
Me mandó un vídeo sexy por snapchat con el filtro de perra
Quién se viene primero en la cama; tenemos guerra
Y el par de dispensario los condones en la cartera
’Ta to' Gucci, ’tá to' Dolce, 'tá to' Versa, ’tá to' Ferra
La amiga seguro también se apunta
Sin echarme perco yo las rompo a las dos juntas
¿Que si soy un bellaco? Diablo, baby, qué pregunta (Ja)
Un hijueputa siempre se lo cambia 'e ruta
Y no fantasmean pa llegar-le
Mientras prendo tienen que besar-se
Vivo así, tuve que acostumbrar-me
Me gustan las dos en cuatro porque lo tienen rosita como el tussy (uh)
A una yo la azoto con la Gucci (ey-ey)
Me gusta verla brincar, las sabana' apretar
Adentro no la vo'a echar
No te vaya' a equivocar

[Cauty]
(Young Cauty)
Que clase de noche me espera
Un poquito 'e hookah te marea
Fue a sacar los chavos, y se me caen en los condones 'e la cartera
Tranquila, si quiere lo' dejo' y vamo' acapella (uh)
Good morning, hello
Es su experiencia de trabajo puso, ""blow""
3 de la mañana en la disco, ouh
Te brinca el booty al ritmo del dem-bow

[Cauty]
Están prendiendo otro, y yo arrebata'o
No sé como es que la mala no me ha da'o
Ella se me pega y se mueve de la'o a la'o, a la'o
Piensan que yo estoy quita'o, pero están equivoca'o (eh)

[Cosculluela]
Mi Cuchi-Cuchi, le gusta R.D., sábanas Gucci (Ah)
Y que la meta pa' dentro de la duchi'
Se tira pa'l threesome (Wooh)
Contra la pared aunque rompa el yeso
Dicen que soy el mejor aunque ya tengo veinte seasons (Jaja)
Veintitres, quiere que la grabe pero con la red (Oh)
Que apague la' luce' y prenda la' LED
Yo le meto y grita, fuma krippy solamente en pipa
Y le doy cuando quiera, no saco cita'
Porque 'ta to' Gucci, 'to bien ('Tá to good)
Mami, pa' adentro 'e la discoteca metimo' la' herramien' (Brr)
El que me venga a hablar, que me hable bien (Oye)
El que me dé cotorra, fácil se puede llevar cien (Brr)

[Coro]
Y 'tá to' Gucci, ey (ey)
A ella le gusta fumar la cripa
Pero siempre en pipa y pa' lo munchies sushi, ey
Me salió media bicha la tipa, pero lo amerita

Así que 'tá to Gucci, ey
Como el father yo le digo ""cuchi-cuchi"", ey-ey
Tiene una amiga media buchi
Así que si pa' un threesome se activa, má' na' se diga

[Rafa Pabón]
Bien arrebata'
El krippy le está dando patá
Hasta gotas se unta, pero la nota la delata
Esa mujer es P y no es de pirata, S.A.T.A, sata
Cuando fuma se pone P de P.A.T.A
Suelta con la de abajo
Peleó con el novio, pa' salir le importa un carajo
Sata pide crema pa'l tajo

[Rafa Pabón, Cauty]
Y se la voy a dar (Se lo voy a dar)
Le dije, ""Aprieta el pote"" pa' sacar la crema y podértela untar"" (Apriétalo)
Si tiene una pana vamo' pal threesome, y se pueden juntar
Se puede apuntar, sin preguntar
Me voy a apretar
Y después que me venga, voy a pichear
Y si me llama slide, a rechazar (decline)

[Darell]
(Everybody Go To The Discotek!; ¡Ratatatá!)
Mami, 'ta to' Gucci y Louis Vuitton (Eso e' así)
Adentro 'e la cartera, la corta má' el botón (Pa'´que sepa)
No le hable' de película, es peliculón (Hah)
Que aquí hace tiempo la tenemo' en on (Rata-ta-tá)
Tú y yo tenemo' conección (Eso e' así)
Pégate pa' acá, bebé, sin la preocupación (Por ley)
Estoy esperando a que tome' la decisión (Oh-oh)
¿Que tú quiere' hacerte to'a?, dime cuánto es la inversión (Oh-oh)
Que yo te lo' voy a dar ahora (Eso e' así)
Si yo te lo hago apuesto que tú te enamora' (Pa'`que sepa)
Yo no te miento a ti, te estoy hablando 'e cora'
Treinta y cinco mil por party, y sólo canto media hora
Mucho Gucci, mucho Gucci, mucho Fendi
'Tá bien, yo soy un loco, pero ma', tú ere' tremendi' (Por ley)
Pégate y te vo'a morder la bembi
Y deja al novio tuyo que tiene el Mercede' empty (Oh-oh)

Lyrics
Can’t seem to take my eyes off you
Especially your python move
The way you roll that thing
Me wan hold that thing
Baby let me take a look
 
Oh lord
Me want all the girls in da whole world 
I know what I’m doing is so wrong 
But since no man can focus
We definitely don’t give a f*ck
 
 
She said she know me got a girlfriend 
And so what
What if i
What if i
What if i
What if I do
She said She know me got a woman on me bed
What if i
What if i
What if i
What if i do
 
 
Listen to me quick 
So me girlfriend say she wants me back home by 2
What will I do?
So me tell her say my car broke down at mile 2
Girl I won’t be home so soon 
 
Oh lord
Me want all the girls in da whole world 
I know what I’m doing is so wrong 
But since no man can focus
We definitely don’t give a f*ck
 
 
She said she know me got a girlfriend 
And so what
What if i
What if i
What if i
What if I do
She said She know me got a woman on me bed
What if i
What if i
What if i
What if i do
Gyal i am wayward 
Be like na the only way forward 
Your back looking like two planets
You’re not from this same world
Gyal i am famous 
Swear down I’m a playboy too
And if you burst up my brain too much 
I swear i fit break up  woyoi
 
 
Can’t seem to take my eyes off you
Especially your python move
The way you roll that thing
Me wan hold that thing
Baby let me take a look
 
Oh lord
Me want all the girls in da whole world 
I know what I’m doing is so wrong 
But since no man can focus
We definitely don’t give a f*ck
 
 
She said she know me got a girlfriend 
And so what
What if i
What if i
What if i
What if I do
She said She know me got a woman on me bed

LYRICS:
I’ve got a lot of bad things in my mind
The simulation crashing by design
And my mind is dangerous
Don’t play with things you don’t
know know know know

I’m falling into dark thoughts that I find
Reality is long gone but that’s fine
And my mind is dangerous
Don’t play with things you don’t
know know know know

I know you hate to see it, but you never wanna talk about it
And hate yourself a little more when you can’t live without it
It’s like praying for rain when you’re already drowning
You’re already drowning, Yeah

So go ahead and twist the knife, I can’t feel the damage
Always searching for the high, never kicked the habit
It’s like praying for rain but I’m already drowning

I keep staring at the sun
it’s in my blood
I’m heading for disaster
Burn bridges just for fun
Have I gone numb? it’s a God damn shame
I push away the people that I love the most
Addicted to the feeling and the chemicals
I’m holding onto hope, but it only destroys me
Cause I’m in love with bad things
Yeah I’m in love with

I keep on falling like it’s summer going into autumn
I keep on digging even though I’m bout to hit the bottom
I keep praying for change, but I never found it, no I never found it

Yeah

So go ahead and twist the knife, I can’t feel the damage
Always searching for the high, never kicked the habit
It’s like praying for change but I never found it

I keep staring at the sun
it’s in my blood
I’m heading for disaster
Burn bridges just for fun
Have I gone numb? it’s a God damn shame
I push away the people that I love the most
Addicted to the feeling and the chemicals
I’m holding onto hope, but it only destroys me
Cause I’m in love with bad things
Yeah I’m in love with

Looking into the abyss, the future is a myth
I’m holding onto hope, it’s a problem I admit
Letting go of my fear, a feeling I miss
The Devil is real and I’m caught in his grip
Looking into the abyss, the future is a myth
I’m holding onto hope, it’s a problem I admit
Letting go of my fear, a feeling I miss
The Devil is real
And I’m caught in his grip

I keep staring at the sun
it’s in my blood
I’m heading for disaster
Burn bridges just for fun
Have I gone numb? it’s a God damn shame
I push away the people that I love the most
Addicted to the feeling and the chemicals
I’m holding onto hope, but it only destroys me
Cause I’m in love with bad things
Yeah I’m in love with bad things
Yeah I’m in love with

The Devil is real and I’m caught in his grip

Lyrics:

Your cruel device,
Your blood like ice.
One look could kill,
My pain, your thrill.

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison runnin through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains.

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat","Temptations   ""Ain't too proud to beg""",Xanemusic - Topic,Louis Bell,

Lyrics:
I don’t know how we got to where we are
So far removed I don’t know where to start
‘Cos I’ve been away for far too long but I implore you please hold on
I beg you please hold on 

Love don’t come easy to us 
and its killing me to hang on and hope its enough

So I was just wondering 
Could you tell me is it all a waste of time
Are you leaving my love behind
Baby say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something 
I swear that I wont try to change your mind
If you’re leaving my love behind
Baby say the word and let me go

We used to wait up and talk for hours on end
And its got me thinking that lately something’s changed
Cos I’ve been feeling you’re leaving 
Cracks in conversations way too long
I’m barely holding on 

Love don’t come easy to us 
And its killing me to hang on and hope its enough

So I was just wondering 
Could you tell me is it all a waste of time
Are you leaving my love behind
Baby say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something 
I swear that I won’t try to change your mind
If you’re leaving my love behind
Baby say the word and let me go

Just let me go
Let me go
Just let me go
Just let me go
Baby say the word and let me go

I was just wondering 
Could you tell me is it all a waste of time
Are you leaving my love behind
Baby say the word and let me know
You gotta give me something 
I swear that I won’t try to change your mind
If you’re leaving my love behind
Baby say the word and let me go
Just let me go 
Just let me go
Baby say the word and let me go

It’s one of several cover songs we put on the ‘Trip Tape’ mixtape which is streaming now everywhere.

LYRICS
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day

Save your tears for another day

So
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah)
I said save your tears for another day (Ah)

Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

LYRICS:
Half of my high school got too drunk
Half of my high school fell in love
With the girl next door
In their daddy’s Ford
Half of my main street’s mini skirts
Half of my main street’s dressed for church
It could use some rain
And a fresh coat of paint
 
Half of my hometown’s still hangin’ around
Still talkin’ about that one touchdown
They’re still wearin’ red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north
Some went south
Still lookin’ for a feelin’ half of us ain’t found
So stay or leave
Part of me will always be
Half of my hometown
 
Half of our prom queens cut their hair
Half of them think that it ain’t fair
The quarterback moved away and never came back
Half of my family is happy I left
The other half worries I’ll just forget
Where I came from
Same place where they came from
 
Half of my hometown’s still hangin’ around
Still talkin’ about that one touchdown
They’re still wearin’ red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north
Some went south
Still lookin’ for a feelin’ half of us ain’t found
So stay or leave
Part of me will always be
Half of my hometown
Half of my hometown
 
Back roads raise us
Highways they take us
Memories make us want to go back
 
To our hometown, settle down
Talk about that one touchdown
Raise some kids in red and black
Go Bobcats, while the other half
Of my hometown was in the crowd
They knew the words
They sang them loud
And all I wanna do is make them proud
‘Cause half of me will always be
Knoxville, Tennessee
My hometown
My hometown

Lyrics:

Check it out, check it out
Here we go - let me say it
Tax on wax make the DJs wanna play it
The front to the front
And the back to the back
The hip to the hop
And the rhyme to the rap
Every single line on the time you admire
Stays in your brain like earth, wind and fire
Here I am all the time, girl, you know me
I must admit, I'm the real Brother Louie!

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love - set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart 
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover",Rise Against - Re-Education (Through Labor) (Uncensored) [Official Video],Emis Killa - Topic,Mike Dean,Bon Iver

Lyrics:
It's your name I hear
It's not my head's whid
Like the many tears I shed
It's your name I call
Your name I read
My prayer
My creed
It's your name I hate
because I love you still
And I can't live this way
It's your name I keep
The only thing
You can't take away from me

I wanna hold you so...
Someday
I'm gonna dive in your eyes...
Deep cast
And I wanna please you so...
Please stay
And I won't lead you...

It's your name I feel
The pact
I seal your name
It's your name I call
Under the sky
Salty like the tears I cried

It's your name I hate
Because I love you still
And I can't live this way
It's your name I keep
The only…

Letra

Quise buscarte para contarte
Vengo a decirte todo lo que siento
Después de tanto retener
Crucé los dedos y rompí el silencio

Pues solo quiero verte y explicarte por qué
No logro estar de pie
No he dejado de amarte
Y no hay nada que yo pueda hacer

Es que lo siento
Cada día yo quise decir te quiero
Hubo veces que fue mi temor escucharte
Cuando sabía que algo no estaba bien

Quise enterrarte para olvidarte
Quise guardarme todo lo que siento
Ahora sé reconocer
Que es el momento de empezar de cero

Pues solo puedo ver que ha cambiado mi papel
Tendido entre tus pies
Y aunque no quiera amarte
No hay nada que yo pueda hacer

Es que lo siento
Cada día yo quise decir te quiero
Hubo veces que fue mi temor escucharte
Cuando sabía que algo no estaba bien

Aunque quise seguir y mirar a otra parte
Hoy vengo a repetirte que, he, he

Es que lo siento
Cada día yo quise decir te quiero
Quiero recuperarte y borrar lo que ya fue
Bajo el yugo del ayer
Que se espina, que lastima la tristeza que me domina
Quiero abrazarte y saber qué se siente renacer
En la vida y volverte a amar

LYRICS
Oh, her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying 
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so, sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look ok, I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are. Yeah.

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know, I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So, don't even bother asking if you look ok
You know I'll say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are
The way you are, the way you are
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are. Yeah.

Lyrics :
Main teri aankho mein udaasi kabhi dekh sakda nai, 
tujhe khush main rakhunga soneya. 
Main tere hotho pe khamoshi kabhi dekh sakda nai, 
sari baatein main sununga soneya. 
tere dil se na, kabhi khelunga 
sare raaz apne, tujhko de dunga 
Meri jaan tune mujhko pagal hai kiya 
mera lagda na jiya 
tere bager.. 
Tu maan meri jaan 
main tujhe jaane na dunga 
main tujhko apni baahon mein chhupa ke rakhunga. 
Tu maan meri jaan 
main tujhe jaane na dunga 
main tujhko apni aankho mein basake rakhunga. 
Tu maan meri jaan 

(Verse2) 
Main saya banke saath tere rehna 24 ghantey 
Main rehna 24 ghantey 
(Tere bina dil lagda nai) 
Main aankhon se churalu jana tere jo bhi ghum the 
Haye Tere jo bhi ghum the... 
meri baahon me aake tu jaye nahi 
esi rabb se main maangu duaa...
tere dil se na,kabhi khelunga 
sare raaz apne,tujhko de dunga 
Meri jaan tune mujhko pagal hai kiya 
mera lagda na jiya 
tere bager.. 
Tu maan meri jaan 
main tujhe jaane na dunga 
main tujhko apni baahon mein chhupa ke rakhunga. 
Tu maan meri jaan 
main tujhe jaane na dunga 
main tujhko apni aankho mein basake rakhunga. 
Tu maan meri jaan

Letra de «Entra En Mi Vida»

(Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
(Oooh)

Buenas noches
Mucho gusto, eras una chica más
Después de cinco minutos
Ya eras alguien especial

Sin hablarme
Sin tocarme algo dentro se encendió
En tus ojos
Se hacía tarde y me olvidaba del reloj

Estos días
A tu lado me enseñaron que en verdad
No hay tiempo determinado
Para comenzar a amar

Siento algo
Tan profundo que no tiene explicación
No hay razón ni lógica en mi corazón

Entra en mi vida
Te abro la puerta
Sé que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas
Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego

Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Uhh)

Buenas noches
Mucho gusto, ya no existe nadie más
Después de este tiempo juntos
No puedo volver atrás

Tú me hablaste
Me tocaste y te volviste mi ilusión
Quiero que seas dueña de mi corazón

Entra en mi vida
(Aaah)
Te abro la puerta
Sé que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas
(Aaah)


Entra en mi vida
(Aaah)
Yo te lo ruego
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Entra en mis horas
Sálvame ahora
Abre tus brazos fuerte
Y déjame entrar

Entra en mi vida
(Ooh)
Te abro la puerta
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Sé que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas
(No más noches desiertas)

Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego 
(Yo te lo ruego)
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

(Oh, oh, oh)

Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Lyrics:

She said I'm sorry baby I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new he's waitin' in the car outside
Ah honey how could you do it
We swore each other everlasting love
She said well yeah I know but when 
We did - there was one thing we weren't
Really thinking of and that's money

Money changes everything 
Money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doin'
That don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now

""India is special and its beauty absolutely humbled me. When we toured there as Major Lazer, it was mind blowing to see our fan-base and we wanted to incorporate the attitude and positive vibes into our video and just do something that embodies the essence of Major Lazer. Major Lazer has always been a culture mashup and to us, India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future. The experience is something we'll never forget.""

Lyrics:
sun in my eyes
navy blue skies
you are the reason
i can survive
we’ll turn off the phones
to just be alone
we’ll draw the curtains
and never leave home

i had a nightmare
but now that i’m not scared
this is how you fall in love
let go and i’ll hold you up
so pull me tight and close your eyes
oh my love,
side to side
what’s easy is right
my mother’s advice
you are the reason
i never think twice
 
wherever we go
what glitters is gold
you’ll be my best friend
until we grow old
i had a nightmare
but now that i’m not scared
this is how you fall in love
let go and i’ll hold you up
so pull me tight and close your eyes
oh my love,
side to side

Letra:
Tentaram me parar, me fazer desistir
Mas eu não vou negar a fé que há em mim
Eu tenho a missão, eu vou seguir Jesus
Porque eu não abro mão do evangelho da Cruz
 
Mesmo que pedras venham contra mim
E com palavras queiram me intimidar
Maior é Aquele que está em mim
Com Jesus sempre vou me levantar
 
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Eu clamo Aba Pai, oh vem com Seu poder
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Nada pode parar o Autor da Vida
 
Mesmo que pedras venham contra mim
E com palavras queiram me intimidar
Maior é Aquele que está em mim
Com Jesus sempre vou me levantar
 
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Eu clamo Aba Pai, oh vem com Seu poder
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Nada pode parar o Autor da Vida
 
Pode o silêncio até gritar que Deus me abandonou
Eu vivo pela fé e tenho um Deus que estende a mão
Pra me levantar
Sei em quem eu tenho crido e que é poderoso
Pra fazer além
E essa é a hora, Deus toca, renova
Transforma, tenho vida em Deus, vida em Deus
Tenho força em Deus
Esperança em Deus
Tenho tudo em Deus
 
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Eu clamo Aba Pai, oh vem com Seu poder
Eu olho pra Jesus, pro amor de Deus na Cruz
Nada pode parar o Autor da Vida

Lyrics

Suspended in the air
I hear myself breathing
Hanging by a thread
My heart is barely beating

I haven't fallen yet
But I feel it comin'
Tell me would it be too much to ask
If you break it to me gently

And I'm waking the next day
Without you beside me
And you hold on to the day
Tomorrow will just be a memory

That I would look back at all of this
And wonder why I stayed in here
Just to watch you disappear

So I breathe and let you go
How do I breathe and let you go?

Before it's too late
I'll take a step away
I know one word would make me go
Rushing back to you

So I'll just shut my eyes
Forget that you were mine
How do you go from making one your home
And then just letting it all go

Let me take it in
Before it sinks in

I'll be on my knees
Is the future you promised
Know what I never even had
I have every reason to miss

And I down away
I can't find the strength to let you go
When the only love I've come to know

Have this past and left me alone
You found another home

So before it's too late
I'll take a step away
I know one word would make me go
Rushing back to you

And I'll just shut my eyes
Forget that you were mine
How do you go from making one your home
And then just letting it all go

Let me take it in
Before it sinks in

(Ohhhhh...)
(Go...)
(Ohhhhh...)
(Go...)

Before it's too late
I'll take a step away
I know one word would make me go
Rushing back to you

I'll just shut my eyes
Forget that you were mine
How do you go from making one your home
And then just letting it all go

Let me take it in
Before it sinks in",,David Guetta,Louis Bell,Bruno Mars

Adagio sostenuto (from Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas)
 
The first single and music video from his new studio recording of all Beethoven 32 Piano Sonatas. 
 
► Buy/stream the single & album here: https://igorlevit.lnk.to/BeethCompSonLY      
 
Igor Levit's work on the 32 Beethoven Piano Sonatas has been the most important endeavour of the past 15 years of his life. This autumn will see his new studio recording of the complete sonata cycle released on Sony Classical on September 13 and represents the recorded testament to almost half his life spent in the study and performance of these sonatas. The release of this momentous 9-album cycle is one of the most eagerly awaited recordings for the 250-year Beethoven anniversary.
                                                        
Levit will perform the complete sonata cycle over the next two seasons in Luzern's KKL (launching in August), Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie (launching in September) and Stockholm's Konserthuset (launching in February 2020). He will also present all-sonata recitals, amongst others, at New York's Carnegie Hall, Washington's Kennedy Center, Chicago Symphony Center and San Francisco Symphony's Davies Hall in May 2020 - more tour dates below.

International release date: 13 Sep 2019

Lyrics: 

I only see you and I
In a crowded room you’re my decision
Oh we been blurring the lines
In a crowded room I guess I kissed him
Kissed him

Oh now baby hold on hold on
Pushed you back for so long
And I’m all out of good excuses now baby
Alright alright
I can’t wait one more night
I give up, I give in I can’t take it

Won’t you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall baby

Won’t you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

I need you to
Let your water fall
Oh now baby
Let me feel it all

This may be a mistake
But I want your tattoos on my shoulders
If you was bourbon and pain
I’d raise you to the sky and toast this
Hopeless
Oh now baby hold on hold on
Pushed you back for so long
And I’m all out of good excuses now baby
Alright alright
I can’t wait one more night
I give up, I give in I can’t take it

Won’t you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall baby

Won’t you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

Give me something to live for
Give me something to love
Give me someone to hold on to
I’ll put nothing above
Give me something to live for
Give me something to feel
Give me something to hold on to
Give me something that’s real

Never had a lover like you
No
It’s the kinda loving I do
Want
Settled so I’m settling 
Love (him) and I’m telling him

In her element yeah
Never had a lover like you

Want
Settled so I’m settling 
Love (him) and I’m telling him

In her element yeah
Won’t you please
Pour your loving over me

Lyrics:

3am and I’m still awake
I bet you’re just fine, fast asleep in your city 
That’s better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I’ll bet your friends tell you she’s better than me
Huh

Well I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh they sit around talking ‘bout the meaning of life
And the book that just saved ‘em that I hadn’t heard of

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet you couldn’t believe 
When you realized I’m harder to forget
Than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver spoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills 
I was raised on a farm, no it wasn’t a mansion
Just living room dancing and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
You can’t help who you fall for 
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we’re too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinking
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don’t have to be your shrink to know that
You’ll never be happy
And I bet you think about me 

I bet you think about me, yes, I bet
You think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud saying 
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad 
That the love that you’re looking for
Is the love that you had

Now you’re out in the world, searching for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status 
Last time you felt free was when none of that shit mattered
Cause you were with me

But now that we’re done and it’s over
I bet it’s hard to believe
But it turned out I’m harder to forget 
Than I was to leave 
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me  
I bet you think about me when you’re out 
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say “oh my god
She’s insane, she wrote a song about me”
I bet you think about me

Official Lyrics: 
How many times can I tell you 
You’re lovely just the way you are 
Don’t let the world come and change you 
Don’t let life break your heart 

Don’t put on their mask 
Don’t wear their disguise 
Don’t let them dim the light that shines in your eyes 
If only you could love yourself the way that I love you 

How many times can I say 
You don’t have to change a thing 
Don’t let the tide wash you away 
Don’t let worry ever clip your wings 

Discard what is fake 
Keep what is real 
Pursue what you love 
Embrace how you feel 
If only you could love yourself the way that I love you 

And if you ever choose a road that leads nowhere 
All alone and you can’t see right from wrong 
And if you ever lose yourself out there 
Come on home and I’ll sing you this song 

So how many times can I tell you 
You’re lovely just the way you are 
Don’t let the world come and change you 
Don’t let life break your heart",Latto - Wheelie (Official Video) ft. 21 Savage,laperche100,,

Lyrics:
The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas

Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you gotta be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby

Why'd you only call me when you're high?
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""

Letra/Lyrics:

Nos faltó una noche de franela
De pijama feo y calcetín por fuera
De sofá con ducha fría y traicionera
Con masaje, crema, una copita y velas
 
Nos faltó una mentira entera
Una falsa espera y una tarde fea
Nos faltó desdibujar tu nombre
Y nuestro corazón de toda la escalera
 
Nos faltó una sábana de Ikea
Un viaje de cartón, un despertar de seda
Un día remolón y una caricia vieja
Un vámonos pa’ allá y un sea donde sea
 
Nos faltó una noche sin dormir
Y un baile de salón en una calle estrecha
Nos faltó descaminar Madrid
Desencallar el fin y reservar la fecha
 
Y sobraron los cuatro disparos
Que con tanto descaro nos dio el corazón
 
Y sobraron los veinte puñales
Y es que a veces la vida no atiende a razón
Y entre sobras y sobras me faltas
Y me faltan las sobras que tenía tu amor
Y sobraron las quinientas veces que dijimos que no
 
Nos faltaron un par de señales
Unos cuantos rivales
Y un trocito de adiós
Nos faltó despertar con abrazos
Nos faltó una deriva por dos
 
Y sobraron los cuatro finales
Que con tanto detalle nos dio el corazón
 
Y sobró lo de ser incapaces
Y es que a veces no afina ni rima el valor
Y entre sobras y sobras me faltas
Y me faltan las sobras que tenía tu amor
Y sobraron las quinientas veces que dijimos que no
 
Y sobraron los cuatro disparos
Que con tanto descaro nos dio el corazón
 
Y sobraron los veinte puñales
Y es que a veces la vida no atiende a razón
Y entre sobras y sobras me faltas
Y me faltan las sobras que tenía tu amor
Y sobraron las quinientas veces que dijimos que no

The children bound in bright steps to the march of the music and perform a dance around the Christmas tree.

The Nutcracker by Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic (Berliner Philharmoniker) remains one of the most iconic recordings of Tchaikovsky’s beloved ""fairy ballet"". Long after its premiere on December 18, 1892, the Romantic-Era masterpiece has become a staple of the Christmas season in both its original ballet and orchestral forms. Listen to the full album here: https://wce.lnk.to/ntc

Many of its numbers have become world-famous themes, especially prominent in classical music performances and pop culture around the holidays: from the extraordinary opening Miniature Overture to the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, Waltz of the Flowers, Dance of the Reed Flutes, March from Act I, and Trepak (Russian Dance). Conductor Sir Simon Rattle calls The Nutcracker “one of the great miracles in music.”

Lyrics:
Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
I don't know it but I feel it comin'
Might be so sad, might leave my nose running
I just hope she don't wanna leave me

Don't you give me up, please don't give up
Honey, I belong, with you, and only you, baby
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you

Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
Why I feel this way I don't know maybe
I think of her so much it drives me crazy
I just don't want her to leave me

Don't you give me up, please don't give up
Honey, I belong with you, and only you, baby
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you

What if she's fine
It's my mind that's wrong
And I just let bad thoughts
Linger for far too long
What if (if!), she’s fine (fine!)
It’s my mind that’s wrong
And I just (just!) let bad thoughts (thoughts!)
Linger for far too long

Don't you give me up please don't give up
Honey, I belong, with you, and only you, baby
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe

►Lyrics: 

I don’t feel a single thing 
Have the pills done too much 
Haven’t caught up with my friends in weeks 
And now we’re outta touch 

I’ve been driving in LA 
And the world it feels too big 
Like a floating ball that’s bound to break 
Snap my psyche like a twig 

And I just wanna see 
If you feel the same as me 

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life 
Like you’re not really happy but you don’t wanna die 
Like you’re hanging by a thread but you gotta survive cuz u gotta survive 

Like your body’s in the room but you’re not really there 
Like you have empathy inside but you don’t really care 
Like your fresh outta love but it’s been in the air 
Am I past repair 

A little bit tired of tryin’ to care when I don’t 
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope 
A little bit tired of sinkin’ 
There’s water in my boat 
I’m barely breathin’ 
Tryna stay afloat 
So I got these 
Quick repairs to cope 
Guess I’m just broken and broke 

The prescriptions on its way 
With a name I can’t pronounce 
And the dose I gotta take 
Boy I wish that I could count 

Cuz I just wanna see 
If this could make me happy 

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life 
Like you’re not really happy but you don’t wanna die 
Like you’re hanging by a thread but you gotta survive cuz ya gotta survive 

Like your body’s in the room but you’re not really there 
Like you have empathy inside but you don’t really care 
Like your fresh outta love but it’s been in the air 
Am I past repair 

A little bit tired of tryin’ to care when I don’t 
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope 
A little bit tired of sinking 
there’s water in my boat 
I’m barely breathin’ 
Tryna stay afloat 
So I got these 
Quick repairs to cope 

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life 
Like you’re not really happy but you don’t wanna die 
Like a numb little bug that’s gotta survive 
That’s gotta survive

Lyrics:

Side by side
I'll be yours forever
Yes I will
Rain or shine
Any kind of weather
Any kind

There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old and make it new

Eye to eye
It's a blinding confrontation
I said you and I
are a deadly combination

So don't start mixing truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind",NIKI - La La Lost You (Live) | Acoustic Sessions,,Louis Bell,Swedish House Mafia

Smash The House top dogs Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike unite with label regular Timmy Trumpet and hardstyle icon Brennan Heart on a fresh take on Neil Diamond’s timeless soft-rock ballad ‘Sweet Caroline’.

First releasing in 1969, Neil Diamond’s ‘Sweet Caroline’ has been ever-present and may even have a case at being one of the most iconic pieces of music ever written. Over half a century later, the undisputed anthem is still being remixed and played with – the most recent instalment, from Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Timmy Trumpet and Brennan Heart, energises the classic with the heart and soul of hardstyle. This is a cutting-edge and exciting outlook on the boundaries of music and what can be achieved when you ignore them, a track that will undoubtedly have a sea of people chanting the lyrics at the top of their lungs!

Produced by:  Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Timmy Trumpet & Brennan Heart
Written by: Neil Diamond

Since its inception in 2010 Smash the House has rapidly forged a reputation as one of the major players in recent dance music history. Now well into its 12th year and continuing to surge out independent and cleverly crafted releases, the Smash the House imprint has gained popularity for consistently delivering top quality dancefloor bangers, with former 2 x World No.1 DJ’s Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike at the helm once again (having won No.1 title back in 2015 and 2019). 
 
Releasing music from a diverse range of artists that tread a spectrum of A-list names as well as bubbling-up talent, Smash The House has grown a reputation for identifying, supporting and releasing unshakeable anthems.

""Brillante Sobre el Mic'' (Fito Paez)

Hay recuerdos que no voy a borrar,
personas que no voy a olvidar, uh.
Hay aromas que me quiero llevar,
silencios que prefiero callar, uh.

Son dos, las caras de la luna son dos,
prefiero que sigamos, mi amor,
presos de este sol.

Dejar, amar, llorar,
el tiempo nos ayuda a olvidar.
Y allá, el tiempo que me lleva hacia allá,
el tiempo es un efecto fugaz, uh.

Y hay, yeah, hay cosas que no voy a olvidar,
la noche que dejaste de actuar,
sólo para darme amor,
para darme amor, para darme amor.

Yo vi tu corazón
brillante sobre el mic en una mano,
y ausente de las cosas pensaste en dejarlo
y tirarlo junto a mí, junto a mí.

Hay secretos en el fondo del mar,
personas que me quiero llevar,
aromas que no voy a olvidar,
silencios que prefiero callar,
mientras vos jugás.

About the album:
Years of musical knowledge and understanding had passed between Angus and Malcolm Young by the time High Voltage announced the arrival of a new Australian take on rock. With Bon Scott on board, this 1976 American release reduced rock 'n' roll down to rhythm, riffs, and raunch.

LYRICS ////////// BACK ONE DAY (OUTRO SONG) ////////// LYRICS

VERSE 1
All the roads we travelled
The journey of our lives
Take another picture
Before we say goodbye
Arm in arm we’re standing 
Standing side by side
Memories fade but legends never die

CHORUS
One last time let’s live for something
I can feel my blood it’s rushing
This ain’t goodbye we’ll be back someday
And we will find our way
Take control of our fate
And like a car with no brakes
Crash and learn make mistakes
And we’ll be back one day
We‘ll be back one day

VERSE 2
I don’t really ever wanna hold back
I got dreams wanna go fast
Know this energy’s here to last
Not a glass half full overflow that uh
Gotta Keep your eyes up on the prize 
Only got one life so it’s worth a try
To find what makes you feel alive
That’s the only way to live it right uh
And now we’re all doing our own things
But I’ll never forget our glory days 
My mind is full of the memories yea 
And I'll never forget what they meant to me
Don’t worry we’ll be back one day
Just celebrate our glory days
We‘ll be back one day

BRIDGE
Although it‘s over now
Don‘t let it get you down
We‘ll be back around
For now we can feel some sorrow
A new day it starts tomorrow
We‘ll wake up
New dreams to follow
A new goal and brand new motto

CHORUS
One last time let’s live for something
I can feel my blood it’s rushing
This ain’t goodbye we’ll be back someday
And we will find our way
Take control of our fate
And like a car with no brakes
Crash and learn make mistakes
And we’ll be back one day
We‘ll be back one day
We‘ll be back one day

Si todo pensamiento me sabe a tu presencia
cómo hago, dímelo, para no extrañarte;
ya es imposible disimular tu ausencia
si de esta agonía nada puede consolarme.

Adónde están la magia y la fantasía,
adónde el poderoso anillo con la escritura:
""Esto también pasará""
Nada en esta tierra libera a mi alma
de la inquietud que la aprisiona
cuando me faltas, cuando no estás...

Si no hay tiempo ni barreras ni distancias
que separen a dos seres que se aman,
entonces por qué muero al tenerte distante...
Seré yo la maldita excepción a la regla
o serás tú mi vida que dejaste de amarme.

(Fabián Ruiz)

Lyrics:
So this is where I am
Hanging on a feeling
Driving through the valley just to chase the pain again
 
So this is where we are
I should’ve seen it coming
Every time we say goodbye
I say hello again
 
I cried in your dark brown eyes for the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
I died when you left that night
For the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
 
Else i tried to stop the door as it was closing
It was closing
Can’t help the way I keep ignoring every omen
Every omen
 
Heaven knows I should let go
It’s nothing that I don’t already know
 
I kiss you on your neck
You were staring at the ceiling
I should’ve known right then and there you were a runaway
 
 
Oh just make it go away
Can you help me rearrange it?
I’m still making sense of having nothing left to save
 
I cried in your dark brown eyes for the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
I died when you left that night
For the thousandth time
‘Cause you love somebody
 
Else i tried to stop the door as it was closing
It was closing
Can’t help the way I keep ignoring every omen
Every omen
 
Heaven knows I should let go
It’s nothing that I don’t already know
 
We go ‘round again
We jump back in bed
That’s what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens
I look right through them
That’s what you do when you love somebody
 
We go ‘round again
We jump back in bed
That’s what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens I look right through them
That’s what you do when you love somebody
 
When you love somebody
When you love somebody

LYRICS
There’s no greater vengeance 
Than learning to enjoy again 
Hope you get the message 
Nobody’s shatter-resistant 
 
Therapy is tiring 
But so is hiding how you feel
You can bring the villainy
And I can bring the sex appeal
 
Leave me something 
Or let me out I’m starving 
Push me, pull me
Waiting for the start of
 
Things that I want
This happily ever after 
You choke on your words
But you swallow them faster  
I sleep on the couch 
While you’re passed out in the back 
Just want you to be my emergency contact 
 
Balanced on a razor blade 
Lick you like a battery 
Your speakers can’t handle the bass 
But you look good under the LEDs 
 
You’re my angel 
You’re a fucking angel 
You’re my angel 
All mine

LETRA / LYRICS

Fue porque no ardes que no te veo 
fue montar el drama al tinte del pelo 
fue que no me sale y tú no te atreves 
fue el final de mierda de aquella serie 

 
Fue la gata cómplice en el tejado 
fue yo no te araño si me haces caso 
fue la risa plena de aquella foto 
fue que al repetirla ya éramos otros 


Y fue lo que te debo lo que me debes 
fue el combate nulo en cuatro paredes 


Fue sentirme solo estando contigo 
fueron los disparos sin un motivo 
fue la herida abierta sin un consuelo 
fue ya no me mates con un te quiero 

 
Fue ya no te importo lo suficiente 
fue me estoy muriendo a mi quien me entiende  
fue el silencio a gritos del dormitorio 
fue la vida idílica de los otros 


Fue el número puesto en aquel bolsillo 
fue el principio el juego de aquellos niños 
fue la risa tonta de los amantes 
ojalá pudiera ser como antes 

 
Fue que en la terraza tomando el sol 
se cubrió de hielo mi corazón 
fue que mi guitarra también sabia  
que si te nombraba  
a mí me dolía 


Y fue creer que el tiempo lo arreglaría 
y fue porque ante todo yo te quería 

 
Fue sentirme solo estando contigo 
fueron los disparos sin un motivo 
fue la herida abierta sin un consuelo 
fue ya no me mates con un te quiero 

 
Fue ya no te importo lo suficiente 
fue me estoy muriendo a mi quién me entiende  
fue el silencio a gritos del dormitorio 
fue la vida idílica de los otros  

 
Fue la firma el beso sin un contrato 
fueron las mentiras en los zapatos 
fue que el oleaje que en su deriva 
por más que no quiera rompe en la orilla  

 
Y fue que no podía y quería hacerlo 
y fue que tu sentías que estaba muerto 
y fue que si soñando abría las alas  
era porque en el sueño tú siempre estabas  

 
Fue la botella abierta cerrando heridas  
fue beber de tus labios la vida misma  
fue los dos en el coche sin un destino 
tratando de encontrarnos por el camino  

 
Fue sentirme solo estando contigo 
fueron los disparos sin un motivo 
fue la herida abierta sin un consuelo 
fue ya no me mates con un te quiero 


Fue ya no te importo lo suficiente 
fue me estoy muriendo a mi quién me entiende  
fue el silencio a gritos del dormitorio 
fue la vida idílica de los otros

Verse 1:

You’re miserable inside your mind
Oh my, oh my
Been dancing in circles round your lies
You’re stepping on the dreams
Of everyone you meet
This stupidness will get you high (?)

Hook:
Why don’t you just shut up
I’m telling you we’ve had enough of
You and all your bullshit
We’ve heard it all before

Why don’t you just shut up
I know you gonna come
But so, what
Won’t catch you on the fall cuz
You Can’t hurt us anymore

Why don’t you just shut upx2

Verse 2
I wonder what happened to you
Oh my oh my
To make you want to spin the truth
All night all night
You sink your teeth insult
To injury and we watch
Your high horse running on the loose

Hook:
Why don’t you just shut up
I’m telling you we’ve had enough of
You and all your bullshit
We’ve heard it all before

Why don’t you just shut up
I know you gonna come
But so, what
Won’t catch you on the fall

Can’t hurt us anymore

Why don’t you just
Shut up x 2
Why don’t you please
Why don’t you just shut up

E gira gira il mondo e gira il mondo e giro te
mi guardi e non rispondo perché risposta non c'è
nelle parole
bella come una mattina
d'acqua cristallina
come una finestra che mi illumina il cuscino
calda come il pane ombra sotto un pino
mentre t'allontani stai con me forever
lavoro tutto il giorno e tutto il giorno penso a te
e quando il pane sforno lo tengo caldo per te ...
chiara come un ABC
come un lunedì
di vacanza dopo un anno di lavoro
bella forte come un fiore
dolce di dolore
bella come il vento che t'ha fatto bella amore
gioia primitiva di saperti viva vita piena giorni e ore batticuore
pura dolce mariposa
nuda come sposa
mentre t'allontani stai con me forever
bella come una mattina
d'acqua cristallina
come una finestra che mi illumina il cuscino
calda come il pane ombra sotto un pino
come un passaporto con la foto di un bambino
bella come un tondo
grande come il mondo
calda di scirocco e fresca come tramontana
tu come la fortuna tu così opportuna
mentre t'allontani stai con me forever
bella come un'armonia
come l'allegria
come la mia nonna in una foto da ragazza
come una poesia
o madonna mia
come la realtà che incontra la mia fantasia.

You are forever in my life
You see me through the seasons
Cover me with Your hand
And lead me in Your righteousness
And I look to You
And I wait on You

I'll sing to You Lord
A hymn of love
For Your faithfulness to me
I'm carried in everlasting arms
You'll never let me go
Through it all

Q © 2022 #ALBUMMODE

_Rápido llegas y rápido te vas
Entras por alante’ pero sales por atrás (sí)
Mami no quiero que quede en un casi
Contigo siempre quise más
En la cama me das guerra y cuando terminamos paz
Pero tu siempre pendiente a ver que opinan los demás
No hay nadie que me lo haga así
Y aunque lo hubiera no quisiera que fuera nadie más

Parece que olvidaste lo rico que se siente en mi habitación
Tu cuerpo con el mío mai’ combinan de una manera 
que es vernos, apagar las luces, cámara y acción
Y todo sin meter el corazón (yeyeyeyeh)

Ya no está pa enchule
A ninguno le dice, tos’ mejor circulen
Pero cuando tienes ganas todos saben a qué nene acudes
Tengo hueco en mi mente pa’ que te mudes
Y llévame por el mal
hoy te traigo a mis islas para hacerlo VISTA AL MAR
Siempre está caliente pero el corazón frío esquimal
Dale cáele pa’l hotel para hacerte mi ritual
Que tú tienes el poder para jugar con mi mente

Cómo se siente, Cómo se siente 
Sabiendo que de todos soy el diferente
No fuma pero su nota es sobresaliente

Parece que olvidaste lo rico que se siente en mi habitación
Tu cuerpo con el mío mai’ combinan de una manera 
que es vernos, apagar las luces, cámara y acción
Y todo sin meter el corazón

Si te fueras de mi cama sería como LA sin Lebron
Lo tuyo no es genético es un don
Nadie se explica cómo lo mueves tan cabrón

ceado se ve ese cuerpito de tanto ir a la playa
La combi Versace no falla 
Te pediría de rodillas que nunca te vayas
Te darás cuenta cuando ninguno de estos bobos de la talla (yeh)
Mami otro sí, yo no te fallaré
Tus gemidos en mi cabeza no se callan (yeh)
Cada vez que te veo escribo un himno y siempre nos pasa lo mismo

Rápido llegas y rápido te vas
Entras por alante’ pero sales por atrás
Mami no quiero que quede en un casi
Contigo siempre quise más
En la cama me das guerra y cuando terminamos paz
Pero tu siempre pendiente a ver que opinan los demás
No hay nadie que me lo haga así
Y aunque lo hubiera no quisiera que fuera nadie más

Parece que olvidaste lo rico que se siente en mi habitación
Tu cuerpo con el mío mai’ combinan de una manera 
que es vernos, apagar las luces, cámara y acción
Y todo sin meter el corazón

SENTADA DESAPEGADA (Nattan, Felipe Amorim, Mc Mari)
Felipe Amorim/Kaleb Jr/Caio Djay/Cristian Bell)

Eu me apaixonei pela mulher certa 
Que gosta da putaria que gosta do que nao presta
A sociedade ta mal acostumada 
Tem mulher que quer amor mas a minha so quer botada

E so sentada sem amor sentada que nao vale nada
Sentada desapegada 
Bota bota vai bota que eu to descarada
Bota bota vai bota bota aqui na sua danada",,xMOPEx,Juicy J,Major Lazer

The timid confession of an 18 year old girl
""I like you... what can I do""
The third mini-album [REAL] of IU, one of the top K-pop solo female singers with her outstanding emotions and singing, has finally been released. The title song ""Good Day"" is another work by the outstanding team 'composer Lee Min-Soo -- lyricist Kim Ee-Na'. 
The lyrics of the song portray a girl who is in love yet too shy to confess her feelings, expressing the sweetness and uneasiness of a girl's first crush in a pure yet honest manner. No doubt IU's mind-blowing vocals and her timid yet cute performance will make the hearts of all male fans race for her. 

In the music video of ""Good Day"", IU acts out the young girl, honestly depicting the excitement of a crush. The music video contains dramatic structures with lively touches, gaining attention as Chung Jae-Hyung makes his appearance as a music fairy who encourages IU. 

アイユ（IU）_ ジョウンナル（良い日/Good Day）
１８歳少女の慎ましい告白。
""私は．．．彼が好きなのに．．．どうしよう．．．""
天性の感性と歌唱力で歌謡界を代表する女性ソロアーティストに位置づいたアイユの３枚目のミニアルバム[REAL]がついに公開された。 アイユのニューアルバム[REAL]のタイトル曲「良い日」は、もはや説明不要のヒットメーカー、イ・ミンス作曲家とキム・イナ作詞家コンビの作品で、今度もアイユのために力を合わせた。
彼が好きなのになかなか告白できずに恥ずかしがる少女の心を描いている「良い日」の歌詞は、初恋の甘酸っぱい感情を純粋ながらも素直に表現している。 アイユは、「良い日」で爆発的な歌唱力と１８歳少女のはにかむ可愛さを描いたパフォーマンスで全国の'お兄ちゃん'たちの胸をときめかせる予定だ。

「良い日」のミュージックビデオで、アイユは彼に片思いをする少女に扮し、片思いのトキメキを率直に表現した。ドラマチックな映像の構成と軽快なタッチが印象的な今回のミュージックビデオには、チョン・ジェヒョンがアイユのそばで彼女を応援する音楽妖精として登場し耳目を集めた。

18살 소녀의 수줍은 고백
""나는요..오빠가 좋은 걸 어떡해...""
타고난 감성과 가창력으로 가요계를 대표하는 여성 솔로 아티스트로 자리매김한 아이유의 세 번째 미니앨범 [REAL]이 드디어 공개됐다. 아이유의 새 앨범 [REAL]의 타이틀곡인 '좋은 날'은 더 이상 설명이 필요 없는 히트메이커 '이민수작곡가--김이나 작사가' 콤비의 작품으로 다시 한번 아이유를 위해 힘을 합쳤다. 
'좋은 날'은 '오빠'를 좋아하지만 쉽사리 고백하지 못하고 부끄러워하는 소녀의 가슴앓이를 그린 가사는 첫사랑의 달콤하면서도 아릿한 감정을 순수하면서도 솔직하게 표현하고 있다. 아이유는 '좋은 날'을 통해 폭발적인 가창력과 18살 소녀의 수줍은 귀여움을 그린 퍼포먼스를 선보이며 전국의 모든 '오빠'들의 가슴을 뛰게 할 예정이다. . 

'좋은 날'의 뮤직비디오에서 아이유는 오빠를 짝사랑하는 소녀로 분해 짝사랑의 설렘을 솔직하게 표현하였다. 드라마틱한 영상 구성과 경쾌한 터치가 인상적인 이번 뮤직비디오에는 정재형이 아이유의 곁에서 힘을 실어주는 음악요정으로 등장해 이목을 집중시켰다.",Grey - Want You Back (feat. LEON) [Official Music Video],Wolfgang's Lynyrd Skynyrd ,Terrace Martin,Dua Lipa

#ElCondorHerido #DiomedesDíaz #Vallenato 


Letra:
Si yo pudiera alzar el vuelo
Alzar el vuelo como hace el cóndor que vuela alto muy alto
Me fuera lejos, pero bien lejos
Adonde nadie nunca supiera del papá de Rafael Santos

Porque una pena tras otra pena están acabando conmigo
Y yo por ser un hombre tan fuerte he podido resistir

Ay y no me quiero morir
Porque me duelen mis hijos
Ay y no me quiero morir
Porque me duelen mis hijos

Mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido
Ay mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido

Para que plata, si no es por eso
Porque trabajo y en cualquier parte yo me la puedo ganar
Es lo que siento aquí en el pecho
Que con dinero jamás y nunca se puede solucionar

Yo me refiero es a la señora que fue conmigo al altar
Que yo la adoro y la quiero tanto y es la mamá de mis hijos

Pero me da mucho pesar
Que me está quitando el cariño
Pero me da mucho pesar
Que me está quitando el cariño

Mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido
Ay mejor me voy, mejor me voy
Como hace el cóndor herido

Tiene razón ella, tiene razón
En ciertas cosas
Porque deberás yo reconozco de que si soy mujeriego
Pero ella sabe y a mí me consta
Que cuando los dos nos conocimos sabía que era parrandero

Entonces ahora después de viejo vive peleando conmigo
Si llego tarde o llegué temprano es la misma cantaleta

Ay voy a arreglar la maleta y voy a coger mi camino
Ay voy a arreglar la maleta y voy a coger mi camino

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

Adiós, adiós, adiós, adiós
Ya se va el cóndor herido

Lyrics:

Adia I do believe I failed you
Adia I know I let you down
don't you know I tried so hard
to love you in my way
it's easy let it go...

Adia I'm empty since you left me
trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
to see where we went wrong

'cause there's no one left to finger
there's no one here to blame
there's no one left to talk to honey
and there ain't no one to buy our innocence
'cause we are born innocent
believe me Adia, we are still innocent
it's easy, we all falter
does it matter?","Kitni Haseen Hogi - HIT: The First Case | Rajkummar, Sanya | Mithoon, Arijit S, Sayeed Q | Bhushan K",CalibreCincuentaVEVO,Finneas O'Connell,

LYRICS
Slowly
Why’s the morning come so slowly?
When I got no one to hold me through the dark

Patient
They tell me that love is patient
But it never wants to wait on
My drunk heart

So I take all of my all of my all of my
Wasted love
And turn it into wine into wine into wine
In my cup

Dear August
Tell me that there’s light
At the end of all this starless night

Dear August
Please don’t let me fall
‘Cause I don’t know 
Where this road is headed anymore

Fading
Now the summer heat is fading
I spend every evening praying
For the dawn

Save me
Looking for someone to save me
Give me everything you gave me
But your scorn

So I take all of my all of my all of my
Wasted love
Turn it into wine into wine into wine
In my cup

Dear August
Tell me that there’s light
At the end of all this starless night

Dear August
Please don’t let me fall
‘Cause I can’t know 
Where this road is headed anymore

Synopsis: 
Befikre is a story that celebrates being carefree in love.  A quintessential Delhi boy Dharam (Ranveer Singh) comes to Paris for work in search of an adventure. Just when he was about to embark on this journey of his life he bumps into a wild, free spirited, French born Indian girl Shyra (Vaani Kapoor).

A feisty romance ensues between the two in which both of their personalities - one being an equal match for the other are tested to the limit. Battling their ups and downs, both realize that love is a leap of faith that can only be taken by those who dare to love.

LETRA

[Intro]
No esperes que me muera, baby, pa' extrañarme
Se marchitó la flor
Dime si queda amor, pa así no olvidarme
De todo el tiempo que perdí, lo que pediste te lo di
Mentiras que te creí, como loco te perseguí
Pa' nada, malvada, tú me manipulabas
Diciendo que me amabas, esta tormenta no acaba

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy de party
Tú estás llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Ya yo te olvidé, de tu amor me curé
Y ahora estoy de party
Sigues llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Lo nuestro lo enterré y tu foto la borré

[Verso 1: Mora]
Lo nuestro lo enterré, búscalo en el cementerio
Baby, te fuiste a criterio
Tú nunca lo cogiste en serio
Llevando la contraria, yo buscando un punto medio
Tratando de salvar la relación
Y tú pagando con traición
Si estabas conmigo era para llamar la atención
Ese cariño tuyo era de silicón
Un amor de mentira
Llegaste cuando estaba en alto y te fuiste en la caída
Cupido te escribo, pero te fuiste a la huida
Quizá en la próxima vida

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy de party
Tú estás llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Ya yo te olvidé, de tu amor me curé
Y ahora estoy de party
Sigues llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Lo nuestro lo enterré y tus fotos las borré

[Verso 2: Cazzu]
Ya no me escribas para explicarme
Nada de lo que digas va a consolarme
Andamos en guerra y si quieres probarme
Vas a aprender que no puedes ganarme
Cuando tú te fuiste se borró todo el millaje
Te mandé a volar, papi, te saqué un pasaje
Tengo un flow cabrón y eso que ni me lo traje
Si quiere competir, entonces me pongo salvaje
Sé que vas a llorar
Y que te vas a acordar
De todo lo que te hice
Pero sanaron las cicatrices

[Coro]
Y ahora estoy de party
Tú estás llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Ya yo te olvidé, de tu amor me curé
Y ahora estoy de party
Sigues llorando
Con quién estoy te pasas preguntando
Lo nuestro lo enterré y tu foto la borré

Letra:
DY
00:00 - 00:30
Antes de que digas nada ya tus ojos me confirman todo
Es verdad lo que me dicen y para negarlo ya es muy tarde
Me cuidaba de personas como tú pero al final ni modo
Soy humano y tengo mucho más defectos de los que tú sabes 
 
MARC
00:30 - 00:41 
De mi te burlaste y se que lo hiciste con gusto 
pa’ eso eres experta apuntas y nunca te tiembla el pulso 
 
DY
00:41 - 00:50
Cuando hagas tu maleta no olvides llevar tu orgullo 
Lo vas a necesitar pa’ cuando quieras regresar 
 
MARC
00:51 - 1:21
Ya no eres bienvenida aquí 
Si tu amor fue una mentira vete y se feliz
No te preocupes por mi 
que voy a estar mejor sin ti 
anda ve y dile a la gente que yo te jodí 
pa’ que no quedes mal aquí
Y está claro que perdiste cuando me perdiste 
Y yo perdí cuando te conocí
 
DY Coro:
1:21 - 1:41
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Voy a amarrar a toa’ las que anden suelta
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Me voy a levantar hasta las que anden muerta 
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Trampa trampita está descubierta
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Tú tenías la llave pero te rompí la puerta 
 
DY
1:42 - 2:12
Cúlpame de tus dolores 
el papel de víctima siempre tiene defensores
Al que miente lo adoran 
al que dice la verdad lo ahorcan 
Felicidades te ganaste un Oscar 
Dios que mi camino alumbre de tus costumbres  
pa’ ti todos los días son 31 de octubre 
siempre con la máscara puesta  
si se te cae una tienes otra de repuesta
ojo que no ven corazón de qué!
Si aunque no te vi tus mentiras yo me las se
Pensé que eras perfecta ahora puedo reconocer 
que tu único defecto fue nacer 
 
MARC Coro:
2:12  - 2:21
Ya no eres bienvenida aquí 
Si tu amor fue una mentira vete y sé feliz
No te preocupes por mi 
 
DY
2:21 - 2:31
que voy a estar mejor sin ti 
anda y ve dile a la gente que yo te jodí
Pa’ que no quedes mal aquí
 
MARC
2:32 - 2:40
Está claro que perdiste cuando me perdiste 
Y yo perdí cuando te conocí
 
DY Coro:
2:40 - 3:03
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
 
MARC
No eres bienvenida bienvenida aquí 
 
DY Coro:
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Sigue en tu viaje y vete por ahí
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
 
MARC
Anda y dile a la gente que yo te jodí 
 
DY Coro:
De vuelta pa’ la vuelta
Pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no
pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no- pero no 
pero no- pero no- pero yo no fui el que aquí perdí 
 
Ataca Yankee
 
Qué! Que!
Fuego!
 
Yankee
 
Dile Marc 
 
Esto es pa’ la historia
 
De aquí pal’ mundo come on! 
 
Ataca Sergio!
 
Ya no eres bienvenida aquí
Salte del medio están pasando los King King King

Ya no eres bienvenida aquí
Besa el anillo el pinky ring ring ring

Ya no eres bienvenida aquí
Barrio Obrero City pa’ toa’ las nenas pretty
 
Ya no eres bienvenida aquí
Nos dicen los Clemente porque tenemos SWING!

Lyrics:

he put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled thetrigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
And when we buried himbeneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Lyrics:
I need you baby, if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby.
Trust in me when I say, OK. (it's OK)
Oh pretty baby, Don't let me down, I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...

Synopsis:
Inspired by real events, Tiger Zinda Hai is a sequel to the blockbuster Ek Tha Tiger, and an espionage action drama that follows a daring rescue mission in Iraq. 
 
When a group of Indian and Pakistani nurses are held hostage in Iraq by the militant Abu Usman, Indian intelligence (RAW) tracks down the reclusive agent Tiger 8 years after he fled with former Pakistani intelligence (ISI) agent Zoya. Joining forces in the name of humanity, Tiger and Zoya lead a team of RAW and ISI agents to covertly enter the hospital where the nurses are trapped, and get the nurses to safety before an American airstrike blows up the hospital. 
 
Tiger Zinda Hai is an all-out entertainer with gritty action, music and drama.

Lyrics:
Recuerdo aquel día
Como si fuera hoy
No hay nada como ella
Y siquiera me encontró
Recuerdo todavía
La vez que la besé
Fue mi primer amor
Y ahora escribo su canción
Hay algo más
Inexplicable como su mirada
Inigualable como la manera en que me cela
Y trata de disimular que no está mal
Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad
Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar
No hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
Se llevó todo, se llevó tristeza
Ya no existe espacio en la melancolía
Porque, a su lado, todo tiene más razón
Me llevé sus lágrimas, llegaron risas
Cuando estamos juntos, la Tierra se paraliza
Se paraliza
Hay algo más
Inexplicable como su mirada
Inigualable como la manera en que me cela
Y trata de disimular que no está mal
Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad
Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar
Voy a cuidarte por las noches
Voy a amarte sin reproches
Te voy a extrañar en la soledad
Y aunque existan mil razones para terminar
No hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
No quiero a nadie más
Ooh, no hay nadie más
No hay nadie

Klaas is highlighting our summer season and gives us some nice 80s flashbacks with his fresh release „Voyage, Voyage“. The song got originally performed by Desireless in 1986 and reached number one positions in over ten countries. Now it was about time to deliver the song with an energetic and new twist while keeping the original vibes… and Klaas really nailed it!

Lyrics:
[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Huh
Yeah, we're comin' back in with another bombtrack
Think ya know it's all of that, huh
Ayo, so check this out, yeah
 
[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Come on
 
[Verse 1: Zack De La Rocha]
Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy

[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh
 
[Verse 2: Zack De La Rocha]
Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The ""land of the free""?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
 
[Bridge: Maynard James Keenan]
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of you
Time has come to pay
[Chorus: Zack De La Rocha]
Know your enemy
 
[Guitar Solo]
 
[Outro: Zack De La Rocha]
Come on
Yes, I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity
Assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy
Brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams
All of which are American dreams

#LaPlata #DiomedesDíaz #Vallenato 


Letra:
Si la vida fuera estable todo el tiempo
Yo no bebería ni malgastaría la plata 
Si la vida fuera estable todo el tiempo
Yo no bebería ni malgastaría la plata  

Pero me doy cuenta que la vida es un sueño
y antes de morir es mejor aprovecharla 
Pero me doy cuenta que la vida es un sueño
y antes de morir es mejor aprovecharla 
 
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando  
 
Todo el mundo pelea si dejo una herencia
si guardo un tesoro o lo gozo yo

Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
Entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios 
Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
Entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios  

Se acaba la vida de este cuerpo humano
Y lo que e guardado no se pa quien es 
Se acaba la vida de este cuerpo humano
Y lo que e guardado no se pa quien es 

En el cementerio estoy vuelto gusano
Y allá están peliando lo que yo deje 
En el cementerio estoy vuelto gusano
Y allá están peliando lo que yo deje 

Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres, bebida y bailando 
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres, bebida y bailando 

Todo el mundo pelea si dejo una herencia
si guardo un tesoro o lo gozo yo

Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios 
Se apodera el diablo de aquella riqueza
entonces no voy a la gloria de Dios 

Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando 
Por eso la plata que cae en mis manos
La gasto en mujeres bebida y bailando

Lyrics:
Hast du dich heute schon geärgert, war es heute wieder schlimm
Hast du dich wieder gefragt, warum kein Mensch was unternimmt
Du musst nicht akzeptieren, was dir überhaupt nicht passt
Wenn du deinen Kopf nicht nur zum Tragen einer Mütze hast

Es ist nicht deine Schuld, dass die Welt ist, wie sie ist
Es wär nur deine Schuld, wenn sie so bleibt

Glaub keinem, der dir sagt, dass du nichts verändern kannst
Die, die das behaupten, haben nur vor Veränderung Angst
Es sind dieselben, die erklären, es sei gut so, wie es ist
Und wenn du etwas ändern willst, dann bist du automatisch Terrorist

Es ist nicht deine Schuld, dass die Welt ist, wie sie ist
Es wär nur deine Schuld, wenn sie so bleibt
Weil jeder, der die Welt nicht ändern will, ihr Todesurteil unterschreibt

»Lass uns diskutieren, denn in unserem schönen Land
Sind zumindest theoretisch alle furchtbar tolerant
Worte wollen nichts bewegen, Worte tun niemandem weh
Darum lass uns drüber reden, Diskussionen sind ok«

Nein – geh mal wieder auf die Straße, geh mal wieder demonstrieren
Denn wer nicht mehr versucht zu kämpfen – kann nur verlieren
Die dich verarschen, die hast du selbst gewählt
Darum lass sie deine Stimme hörn, weil jede Stimme zählt

Es ist nicht deine Schuld, dass die Welt ist, wie sie ist
Es wär nur deine Schuld, wenn sie so bleibt",Sleepy Hallow - Breaking Bad (Okay) ft. Sheff G (Official Video Release),Kappa Originals ,"Noah ""40"" Shebib","Tyler, The Creator"
